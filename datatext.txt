Praise for Tom Venuto and 
BURN THE FAT, FEED THE MUSCLE 
―This book changed my whole life. Without Tom, I‘d still be wasting money on fad diets and miracle 
weight-loss rubbish.‖ 
—Sean, 46 
―I absolutely love his book! It changed my life! I went from being a 190 pound, 411 housewife to a 
120 pound triathlete!‖ 
—Lillian, 41 
―I‘ve tried for about 10 years to look good, lose weight, and be fitter in general—and I am only 29! 
After reading Tom‘s books and articles, it took me about 6 months to be in shape and another 6 
months to get ripped!‖ 
—Ragab, 29 
―I am 60 years old and have lost 30 pounds in 6 months because of his motivation. Only 5 pounds 
more to go to reach my goal!‖ 
—Rocky, 60 
―Tom is straight-shooting and full of common sense and not afraid to say what many people don‘t 
want to hear.‖ 
—Barb, 50 
―I follow Tom without hesitation. He is totally reliable.‖ 
—Chrystal, 59 
―Tom has a unique ability to sift through all the research and present it in a way that makes sense to 
non-experts‖ 
—Anne, 42 
―Tom encourages people all around the world. He is my long-distance personal trainer.‖ 
—Mirisca, 35 
―Mr. Venuto is, in my opinion, one of the finest writers and minds in the field.‖ 
—Michael, 50 
―He is aware of how all sizes and ages react to fitness, and he knows the current triggers to get people 
remotivated to get to goal.‖ 
—Catherine, 51 
―I turn to Tom Venuto for everything that is nutrition-related.‖ 

================================================================================
—Diederik, 32 
―I‘ve read Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle front to back dozens of times, and each time I learn 
something new.‖ 
—Thomas, 30 
―As somebody who had 15kg excess weight, but didn‘t eat very much and exercised every day, I 
couldn‘t understand why I didn‘t have a good figure. I thought it was unfair, and wondered if it was 
my age or genetics that was the problem. Tom‘s book helped me eat better and shed that weight in 3 
months, and I‘ve kept it off for 18 months so far.‖ 
—Kym, 41 
―I follow Tom‘s nutrition advice, which has helped me to get rid of blood sugar and thyroid problems 
that were troubling me, and I feel a whole lot better.‖ 
—Ilse, 36 
―As someone who would work out 6 or 7 seven days a week and still not see the scale budge, eating 
healthy food and still no results, Tom taught me micronutrients and how to do all the math—not just 
for the general population but for me! It really works! Thank you, Tom!‖ 
—Nancy, 46 
―His advice on goal-setting, revisiting goals, and setting new goals is some of the best ever given in 
the fitness industry. His focus on positive thoughts and actions is also keenly unique, and it works. He 
never waffles and always stays true to what he knows works.‖ 
—Janis, 50 
―Tom has changed my life.‖ 
—Rebecca, 33 
―Tom really enjoys helping others to become fit the right way, not the easiest or quickest.‖ 
—Tim, 57 
―I cannot believe Tom with all his knowledge, BFFM, and the Bodyfat Solution are not on every news 
program and talk show for his remarkable success.‖ 
—Glenn, 48 
―It‘s the only health and fitness book I‘ve ever read that I actually like!‖ 
—Samantha, 35 
―Even though I‘ve never interacted with Tom directly or personally, I‘ve felt as though I‘ve known 
him from the moment I purchased the BFFM ebook. He comes across as truly wanting to help people, 
not simply line his pockets. I‘ve recommended him to many family members and friends.‖ 
—Dave, 44 
―His program works. It keeps me out of the weedy tweaks of the next great thing—supplements, 
etc.—and solidly in a program that works.‖ 

================================================================================
—Sherry, 50 
―Tom Venuto‘s refreshing approach and honesty about what it takes to stay healthy are fantastic and 
what everyone who is serious about taking care of themselves needs in their lives.‖ 
—Paul, 49 
―Tom has inspired me to go forward and motivate myself to reach the leanness I‘ve always been 
looking for.‖ 
—Lorena, 25 
―I have been struggling with the last 25 or so pounds for years, but I feel like I can finally take it off 
now.‖ 
—Karen, 34 
―I recommend Tom‘s books and website more than any other trainer out there.‖ 
—Jennifer, 44

PREFACE 
My Story: 
From Fat Boy to Fat-Loss Expert 
I wasn‘t always a bestselling author, personal trainer, and fat-loss expert, getting written up in Men’s 
Fitness and O, The Oprah Magazine. I certainly wasn‘t winning bodybuilding contests or doing photo 
shoots. All that came much later. At first, I simply had to be honest with myself. I was getting chubby. 
I was never obese, but I do know what it feels like to hate my body and be paralyzed with self-
consciousness. 
When I was a 14-year-old freshman in high school, that‘s when it hit me: I had a roll of fat around 
my waist and what I thought was the worst affliction a warm-blooded male teenager could have—
―man boobs.‖ I dreaded taking my shirt off for swimming class, and when we played basketball in 
gym, I prayed I‘d be called to play for ―shirts,‖ not ―skins,‖ so nobody would see my ―moobs‖ and ab 
flab jiggling up and down the court. 
That same year, I watched a movie called Conan the Barbarian, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
The moment I saw Arnold on the big screen, my whole world stopped. I stared, frozen in awe. I had 
seen cartoons and superhero characters with that kind of body, but I couldn‘t believe a real human 
being could look like that: He had gladiator pecs with slabs of muscle inches thick, shoulders like 
cannonballs, the V-shaped back tapering down to the tiny waistline, chiseled six-pack abs, and the 
arms—they were the most mind-blowing of all—huge, sinewy, and rock hard, with biceps like 
mountain peaks. It was the most awesome physique I‘d ever seen. That was the moment I knew I 
wanted muscles. 
The next day at the newsstand, I picked up a magazine that had a cover photo of Arnold as Conan, 
slathered in warpaint, gripping a sword, biceps bulging. I thumbed through the pages and was blown 
away a second time. The magazine was filled with pictures of dozens of men who looked a lot like 
Arnold, and women who looked like ―warrior goddesses‖ straight out of the fantasy novels. None of 
the bodies in that Muscle and Fitness magazine seemed to have an ounce of fat on them. 
When I saw an ad for Arnold‘s book Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder, I bought it on the 
spot and devoured it in a day. It was part autobiography, part training manual, and I started doing the 
workouts from the back of the book. The first program consisted of body weight, or what Arnold 
called ―freehand‖ exercises. I did it for a month but got bored very quickly. He emphasized that these 
were not sissy exercises, and anyone who has tried a body weight pull-up the first time knows it‘s true. 
But I wanted to do what Arnold did—pump iron—so I moved on to the ―real workouts‖—the ones 
with barbells and dumbbells in the chapter called ―Progressive Resistance Weight Training.‖ 
From the first workout, I was hooked. If you wanted to stop me from training, you‘d have had to 
pry the barbell out of my cold, dead hands. I kept after it. By my senior year in high school I didn‘t 
look anything like Arnold, but I had put on about 25 pounds of muscle. I was stronger and I did look a 
lot better. But I didn‘t have it right yet. I had been building up the muscle, but the whole burning-fat 
part eluded me. 
After four years of lifting weights, my abs were still hidden underneath my belly fat. I still couldn‘t 
take my shirt off in public without feeling self-conscious. Maybe you can relate to this feeling. You‘ve 
worked hard for a long time, maybe years, but still feel trapped inside a body that‘s not doing what 
you want, no matter what you try. You think your frustration just can‘t get any worse. Well, mine did. 

================================================================================
It happened when I went to college … and discovered beer. Combined with late-night pizza, cheese 
fries, and Stromboli, plus hungover Sunday morning binges on syrup-smothered pancakes, I quickly 
gained the classic ―freshman 15‖ (for me, it was more like 20). I was now 45 pounds heavier than I 
was when I started high school, so I was no pipsqueak, but believe me, it wasn‘t all muscle. I was 
what you‘d call ―bulked up.‖ My college roommates even had a nickname for me: ―Bob‘s Big Boy,‖ 
after the fast food restaurant‘s chubby mascot. Sometimes they just called me ―Fat Boy.‖ 
I took the taunting quietly and laughed along with them, but deep down I was humiliated because I 
was a die-hard bodybuilding fan and self-proclaimed ―muscle guy,‖ but I had a beer belly to go with 
my biceps. What made matters worse was that I‘d declared my major in exercise science. I was in 
college, planning for a career in fitness after graduation, but my behavior and physical condition were 
incongruent with my goals. I felt like a hypocrite. 
I knew at that point I had to do something. Fortunately, I never stopped lifting weights. Even with 
one foot in the college party lifestyle, I still kept the other in the gym. My friends at the gym always 
supported me and told me exactly what to do: Enter a bodybuilding contest for motivation. Why not? I 
had already built the foundation of muscle underneath the fat. I‘d thought about competing before and 
prattled on about doing it all the time. But up until then I was all talk and no walk. The only title I had 
won was ―Mr. Procrastinator.‖ 
Something had to give, or I would be the laughing stock of my gym as well as the clients I would 
soon be training. It wasn‘t until my gym buddies challenged me to stop talking and commit to training 
for a contest that everything started to change. I finally got serious about figuring out what these guys 
were doing right. They certainly were doing something to get lean and ripped that I wasn‘t doing. 
I read everything I could get my hands on about competition prep and picked the brain of every 
bodybuilder I met. My training partners and gym friends who had already competed taught me their 
unique ―bodybuilder‘s diet‖ that they used to strip off all the fat, right down to the six-pack abs—just 
like the models in the magazines. I paid attention, I listened, and I took action. 
I started working out and eating in a certain way, and it quickly became clear that I was onto 
something. ―Contest training‖ was by far the most effective program I had ever followed. My body 
was changing faster than ever and the belly fat seemed to melt away by the day. 
I came to some realizations about my past mistakes. First, I knew I‘d been missing a major piece of 
the puzzle. It‘s not enough to work out; you have to get the nutrition right. That‘s the most important 
element. The cliché ―You can‘t out-train a bad diet‖ is absolutely true. When I added the proper 
nutrition on top of the right training, the magic started happening. Second, I realized the importance of 
having a goal and an emotional reason why you absolutely must achieve that goal. 
This combination of nutrition and training with a motivating goal worked so well that I not only got 
second place in my first competition, I did better every time I stepped onstage. I won my weight class 
in my second competition and I won the overall title in my third. I captured the Pennsylvania, New 
Jersey, and New York state championships and then went on to regional competition, winning the 
mid-Atlantic states and my weight class at the Natural Eastern Classic. I went as far as runner-up at 
the Natural Mr. America and Natural North America. All of these competitions were drug tested and I 
reached contest condition 100 percent drug-free. 
Beer belly? Gone. Moobs? Nowhere in sight. I traded the six-packs of beer for six-pack abs. I was 
not only ripped for the first time in my life (finally!), my abs were on the front page of the sports 
section in our small-town newspaper! It wasn‘t long before I was in the magazines. 
Maybe you‘ve seen that old Charles Atlas ad where the skinny kid gets sand kicked in his face by a 
muscle-bound bully, then gets in shape and beats up the bully? That‘s kind of how it felt. It felt like 
redemption. It was like getting to tell the world, ―Hey, remember that kid from gym class with the 
man boobs? Well, take a look at this!‖ I‘m not saying any of this was easy. I‘m saying it was worth it. 

================================================================================
I‘m also not telling you this story to brag or hold myself up as some kind of ―poster boy.‖ Quite the 
opposite. For years I‘ve been an under-the-radar kind of coach and athlete, who doesn‘t care much 
about being in the limelight. I get more satisfaction from making fitness stars out of my clients and 
readers. There are literally thousands of my client‘s stories that are more inspiring than mine … stories 
from ordinary men and women who have no interest in entering a bodybuilding contest, yet use this 
same ―bodybuilder science‖ to achieve their own personal goals, with massive success. 
I‘ve always loved seeing other people succeed, so immediately after graduating, armed with a 
degree, two certifications, and eight years of experience training myself, I dove headfirst into my 
career training others. I worked with hundreds of men and women one-on-one in the gym. Even 
though I was a trainer, not a nutritionist, my appreciation for the nutrition element in the fat-loss 
equation continued to grow when I saw how two clients followed the same workout but one got better 
results than the other. None of them were slackers. My clients trained their butts off. The difference 
was what they did when they left the gym. Some of them controlled what they ate and drank and some 
of them didn‘t. 
When I realized that my clients‘ diets were making or breaking the results of our workouts, I knew I 
had to give them guidance about what to eat. Left to their own devices, who knows what they would 
have done? They might have followed one of those weird weight-loss gimmicks they saw in the 
tabloids or on TV. They might have resorted to diet pills. Or they might have done it right, all week 
long, only to undo it in one weekend binge. The first thing that popped into my mind was, ―Why don‘t 
I show them how I do it?‖ I was working in mainstream health clubs, so very few of my clients were 
bodybuilders. But I figured if I could go from a ―fat boy‖ chugging six-packs of beer to a bodybuilder 
with six-pack abs, why wouldn‘t the same system work for my clients? 
Put simply, if you want to learn how to get really lean, who better to learn from than the leanest 
people in the world? So I decided to share the secrets. I wrote down my fat-burning formula and gave 
it to my clients. It worked like magic! For all of them! Men and women. From soccer moms to 
stockbrokers. From twenty-somethings to retirees. 
As I kept teaching my method to my personal training clients, I also launched a coaching program 
for people who wanted more intensive nutrition guidance, combined with the accountability of a 
personal motivation coach. After 600 clients completed my 12-week coaching program, I had it down 
to a science. I realized that as long as the nutrition was customized for each individual, it would work 
for almost anyone to achieve any goal, whether that was burning the last few pounds of stubborn fat or 
overcoming serious obesity, from just ―firming up‖ to ―ripping up,‖ from brides shaping up for 
weddings to guys chiseling down for the beach. 
By this point, I had amassed an incredible amount of real-world data from all kinds of people. I had 
also developed a food and nutrition manual to give to all my training clients. One day when I was 
printing out the manual for a client consultation, it occurred to me that if I added a few more pieces of 
vital information, I would have my entire coaching system transferred into book form. I went to work, 
and with some late nights and a lot of strong coffee, in a few months I held the first-ever copy of Burn 
the Fat, Feed the Muscle. 
It was 2003. It had taken me nearly 14 years of trial, error, research, and experimentation to put the 
system together. I had already used it to help hundreds of clients transform their bodies, one person at 
a time. I had also written a mission statement for myself: 
I will coach and inspire as many people as possible to strengthen and transform their bodies 
and reach all their health and fitness goals, the natural way. 
To be true to my mission, I had to ask myself, ―How can I help more people?‖ It didn‘t take long to 
find an answer. A colleague told me that getting a publisher was ―almost impossible‖ when you‘re an 

================================================================================
unknown personal trainer. So he self-published his books and made them available on the Internet for 
instant downloads. I said, ―Wait a minute. You mean I don‘t have to print these or haul them to the 
post office? And people can download this in any country? And my readers don‘t have to wait—they 
get the books instantly? And I can do it all myself?‖ 
He said, ―Yes.‖ 
I said, ―Say no more.‖ I became an Internet publisher too. I put up a new website, started an email 
newsletter, and made Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle available as an ebook. 
Back then, most people didn‘t even know what ebooks were. They said no one would pay for a 
download; information on the Internet is free. They laughed at me. But like the critics who told me I‘d 
never make it as a bodybuilder without taking steroids, I ignored them and did it anyway. 
The original Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle became an online sensation. It debuted at number one 
on the fitness ebook charts and stayed there for five years straight, a record that still stands to this day. 
The book reached customers in 154 countries and built a huge online community. It pioneered the 
entire fitness ebook industry, which exploded in the next decade. Many other successful authors 
followed. People went from calling me a fool to calling me the father of fitness ebooks. 
I could have stopped there and retired or kept chugging along quietly online, but my mission 
statement, tacked onto my office bulletin board, kept staring me in the face every day. Again I asked, 
―How can I help more people?‖ At this point, I was no longer an unknown. Millions of people had 
visited my website and a quarter of a million were subscribed to my newsletter. Now agents and 
publishers were knocking on my door. When the offer came to put Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle into 
a print edition, I had my answer. 
This brand-new edition is revised and improved. If the original had any kinks, they‘ve been 
straightened out. If parts fell out of date, they‘ve been updated. If anything was overcomplicated, it‘s 
been simplified. This book contains new material and new workout plans never before published. The 
flagship training program is called The New Body 28 (TNB-28). The original TNB was beta tested 
and fine-tuned for three years by my inner circle members. The schedule fits a busy lifestyle so well, 
and the results were so astonishing, it became the most popular and talked-about workout I ever 
created. 
TNB-28 is the latest evolution of the plan. The new workout has been perfected and is now 
available to you in Chapters 16 and 17 of this book, with extra tools and exercise guides available for 
free on the website at www.BurnTheFatFeedTheMuscle.com. 
Although Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle retains every effective core principle of the original, it has 
been reengineered so that even more people can now easily make the Burn the Fat eating principles a 
part of their lifestyles. In the past, the bodybuilding style of eating was acknowledged as the most 
powerful and effective system in the world for burning fat and building muscle. But it was also known 
for being strict, even dogmatic. Not anymore. This is the next generation of fat-burning and muscle-
building nutrition. 
The new Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is structured and flexible at the same time. You can 
customize it to fit your schedule, your tastes and your lifestyle. You can customize your mealtimes, 
number of meals, type of foods and even the amount of carbs. No foods are off-limits; you can eat 
anything you want, if you follow a few reasonable guidelines you‘ll learn in the nutrition part of the 
book. 
There are four elements to the plan—nutrition, cardio training, weight training, and mental training—
and all four of them can be customized and fine-tuned week by week to help you reach your goals. 
Whether you want to burn 10 pounds, 20 pounds, or 100 pounds, whether you want to build muscle or 
just look ―toned,‖ this program is for you. It‘s not about becoming a bodybuilder, it‘s about using the 

================================================================================
―bodybuilder‘s secrets‖ to reach your own personal goals. It‘s about developing the leanest you, the 
fittest you, the best you. 
Almost everyone is missing at least one piece of the puzzle, and that‘s what holds them back. If 
you‘ve never put all four elements together before, then do it with all you‘ve got for the next 28 days. 
You‘ll be in the best shape of your life and you‘ll be on the road to even bigger—and permanent—
changes as you make this plan a part of your long-term lifestyle. 
When you look back at the origins of this program, you could say that Burn the Fat, Feed the 
Muscle was 30 years in the making and 20 years in the perfecting. You have in your hands one of the 
most tested and proven fat-burning systems ever created. It‘s the original bible of fat loss for hundreds 
of thousands of people worldwide. I hope this brand-new edition of a fat-loss classic becomes your 
health and fitness bible as well.

PART 1 
PHILOSOPHY 
CHAPTER 1 
Fat-Burning Secrets of the Leanest People in the World 
If you want to know about fat loss or muscle building, ask top level bodybuilders. These guys know it. 
In other words, quit buying fat-loss devices off of late night TV ads, quit buying fat-loss stuff that 
grandma tried when her cribbage partner mentioned it, and quit trying fad diets. Instead, listen to 
the best of the best. 
—Dan John, strength coach and author of Never Let Go: A Philosophy of Lifting, Living and 
Learning 
Life is short, time is precious, and you are busy. You don‘t have hours to waste and you want results 
as quickly as possible. So what‘s the fastest way to burn fat and get in great shape? Simple: Model 
yourself after an expert. Any time you attempt something new, there‘s a learning curve, but if you 
have the right coach, you can bypass years of trial, error, and frustration. The big question is, with all 
the noise in the diet and fitness world today, how do you choose your mentors? Who should you listen 
to? What sources can you trust? 
Let me suggest the same strategy to you that I‘ve put to use for my personal training and coaching 
clients for years: If you want to shed fat and build lean muscle, learn from the leanest, best-built 
people in the world—bodybuilders. Why? Again, it‘s simple: Bodybuilders and other physique 
athletes (figure, fitness, fitness model, and bikini competitors) are the world‘s greatest experts in the 
art and science of body transformation. 
Athletes in physique sports do things differently from—sometimes the exact opposite of—everyone 
else. Here‘s just a taste of what this program will reveal about their methods. 
1.  Physique athletes don’t diet—not in the conventional sense. Diets don‘t work; you‘ll find out 
why in the next chapter. In fact, bodybuilders are well-known for how much food they eat. It 
doesn‘t seem possible that you can ―eat more and burn more,‖ but on this plan, you really can. 
2.  Physique athletes are masters at stripping off the last 10 to 15 pounds of stubborn fat. Most 
people get stuck on those final pounds, but this method can strip off all the fat—all the way to 
six-pack abs. You may not want to get so lean that people say, ―Wow, you are ripped!‖ But if 
you do, this is how it‘s done. 
3.  Physique athletes don’t lose muscle. What good is it to lose weight if half of it is lean body 
mass? If you want to lose 20 pounds as fast as possible, we could saw off one of your legs. That 

================================================================================
sounds ridiculous, but it‘s exactly what most people are doing with crazy starvation diets: 
burning off their own muscle. Follow this plan and you won‘t just lose weight, you‘ll burn fat, 
keep muscle, and completely transform your body. 
4.  Physique athletes know how to break plateaus. By tracking body composition (instead of only 
body weight), charting progress, and using a performance feedback loop system, you can break 
any plateau. You‘ll know when you‘re stuck and what to do to get ―unstuck.‖ 
5.  Physique athletes (and fitness models) have to show up in shape on a specific date. If you 
use their system, you can ―dial it in‖ whenever you want to get in peak shape—for a vacation, a 
reunion, a wedding, a whole summer, a body transformation contest, or even your own photo 
shoot. You can get as lean as you want, when you want. You‘ll be in complete control of the 
timing and speed of your results. 
I could go on and on about the unique tactics that bodybuilders use: nutrient timing, carb cycling, 
modified low-carb diets, protein optimization, hydration strategies, macronutrient tweaks that no one 
else talks about—not to mention the unique training style designed to make you stronger and healthier 
and look great naked at the same time. But we‘ll get to these topics soon enough. 
For now, it‘s sufficient to know that Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is a health and fitness 
philosophy that has been quietly tested and proven in the bodybuilding and physique world for 
decades. These are the secrets of the leanest people in the world. Until now the only place you could 
get this kind of information is if you were one of my personal clients, if you are a member of my inner 
circle, or you had your own coach who was privy to the physique athlete style of nutrition and 
training. Now I can be your coach through this book. 
It‘s important to know that this book was written by a bodybuilder, but it‘s not just for 
bodybuilders. Think of using this program as simply ―stealing‖ some of their secrets to help you 
achieve your own personal goals. I do work with physique competitors, and the advanced acceleration 
strategies in the final chapters of this book can be used to go all the way to competition-stage or 
photo-shoot shape. But this book is for any man or woman who wants to shed fat, get lean, and 
transform their body without losing muscle and without starvation, drugs, or diet gimmicks. 
Most people don‘t want to be bodybuilders. But let me bounce an idea off of you. Burn the Fat, 
Feed the Muscle is not about dieting your body down as much as it‘s about building your body up. 
When you follow this program, you‘ll build strength, health, energy, discipline, and self-confidence, 
not to mention lean muscle. I always believed that anyone who lifts weights and feeds their body 
nutritiously could call themselves a ―bodybuilder.‖ 
So after you start the program, why not try that and say, ―I am a bodybuilder.‖ Or say something 
similar that resonates with you more, like ―I am a body sculptor,‖ ―I am a strength athlete,‖ or ―I am a 
fitness athlete.‖ You may not look or feel like one yet, but when you affirm it, you‘ll get there faster. 
It‘s miraculous how the words you use to describe yourself can shape your identity, change your self-
image, and, in turn, change your behavior. You‘ll learn more about the psychology of affirmations in 
Chapter 6. It really is amazing! 
WHY THIS IS THE MOST UNIQUE AND EFFECTIVE FAT-LOSS 
AND BODY-TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM IN THE WORLD 
Before you dive into the program, I want to give you a quick overview of the Burn the Fat, Feed the 
Muscle principles. I‘ll explain the ten most important ways this program is unique, and why I believe 

================================================================================
this is the most powerful fat-loss and body-transformation system ever developed. This will give you 
the big picture, and I hope it gets you even more excited about the journey you‘re about to begin. 
1. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is not a weight-loss program, it’s a fat-loss program. 
Weight loss and fat loss are not the same thing. The scale can be misleading if it‘s the only way you 
measure your progress, because the scale doesn‘t tell you the difference between fat weight and 
muscle weight. For example, a woman could weigh 110 pounds but have 33 percent body fat. That‘s 
what you call a ―skinny fat person.‖ On the other hand, a well-trained female athlete could weigh 150 
pounds and be very lean, with 16 percent body fat. That‘s what you call ―solid muscle.‖ 
What matters most is your ratio of muscle to fat—your body composition. With this distinction in 
mind, losing weight should not be your only goal. Your main focus should be burning the fat and 
keeping the muscle. As long as your body is mostly muscle, then you shouldn‘t worry so much about 
your total body weight. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle will teach you how to measure your body fat 
and use body composition to track your progress. You‘ll learn how to get results as fast as possible, 
but you‘ll also be reminded that there‘s a world of difference between rapid weight loss and 
permanent fat loss. 
2. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is not a diet, it’s a nutrition program. 
Crash diets are tempting because they can produce quick weight loss, at least in the beginning. The 
problem is, when you cut calories too much, or banish entire food groups, you may not get enough 
vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, or fiber. Reduce your carbohydrates too much, and your 
energy level takes a nosedive. If you fall short on protein, you could lose lean body mass, which slows 
your metabolism and makes you softer and weaker. You might weigh less and fit into a smaller size, 
but your body still looks flabby. 
Even if you grit your teeth and willpower your way through an extreme diet for a few months, the 
consequences outweigh the benefits. Deprivation diets make you lethargic, hungry, and miserable. 
You can‘t stay on them forever, so the weight loss rarely lasts. As you read this book, you‘ll discover 
that if you eat the right foods, you can actually eat more and nourish your body with all the nutrients it 
needs. You‘ll not only burn fat faster and keep it off, you‘ll also get healthier and feel more energized 
at the same time. 
3. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is not about nutrition or training; it’s about both. 
You‘ll lose weight on any diet with a calorie deficit, but when you add training, you‘ll burn more fat 
without slowing down your metabolism or losing muscle. Putting training and nutrition together is the 
difference between transforming your body and simply losing weight. Research has also proven that 
exercise is critical for long-term weight maintenance. You might take the fat off with dieting alone, 
but you‘ll have a hard time keeping it off. 
When you make training a part of your lifestyle, you can eat more and still have the caloric deficit 
you need to burn fat. And when your training includes lifting weights, not just cardio, more of what 
you eat is partitioned into muscle. Don‘t starve the fat with diets: Burn the fat with training and feed 
the muscle with nutrition. 
4. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is not only about looking better but also about becoming 
healthier. 

================================================================================
The nutrition and training guidelines I give for transforming your body are the same simple lifestyle 
changes I recommend for good health. If you want to look like a fitness model, get ripped, or peak for 
a photo shoot, a stricter and more sophisticated plan may be necessary. I explain how to ramp up your 
training and tighten up your nutrition to accelerate fat loss in the last part of the book. But after a 
special peaking event is over, you return to the same balanced lifestyle plan. 
There‘s nothing wrong with training harder and using stricter diets to pursue extreme leanness at 
times. And there‘s nothing wrong with setting purely cosmetic (―vanity‖) goals. But there‘s more to 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle than getting super lean. You‘re going to be setting a lot of goals in this 
program. To keep yourself in balance, make sure you set goals for looking great and getting healthier. 
This means following sensible nutrition and training practices, as well as avoiding drugs or potentially 
harmful diet pills. It means 100 percent natural! 
5. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is a lifestyle, not a quick fix. 
The word ―diet‖ comes from the Latin diaeta, meaning ―way of life.‖ Today, however, I think the 
word ―diet‖ carries too much negative baggage to use so loosely. The way I define it, a diet is any 
temporary change in your eating behavior to try to lose weight. When you say you‘re going on a diet, 
you‘re implying that at some point you‘re going off it. 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is not something you go on and off; it‘s a lifestyle. The only way 
you‘ll get lean and stay lean is to choose new behaviors, develop new habits, and maintain them for 
life. You‘ll need a calorie deficit during your fat-loss phase, but the rest of your nutrition will be 
similar all year round, regardless of whether your goal is burning, building, or maintaining. 
This program is not a quick fix. But you will get results quickly. If you‘ve never used a program 
like this before—one that covers all bases—and if you diligently put into action all four elements of 
the plan at the same time, you will see incredible results in the first 28 days. You will lose pure fat, not 
just weight, you will transform your body shape and you will already have new habits established that 
will keep you lean for life. 
6. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is based on science and experience, not one or the other. 
Most scientists live by the credo ―Prove all things.‖ That‘s good advice for the rest of us, too, 
especially when we‘re evaluating claims that seem too good to be true. Science and critical thinking 
are important tools for helping us design our fitness programs, sort through information overload, and 
avoid being taken by charlatans and con artists. 
However, being so scientific and skeptical that you trust studies over your own experience can be 
hazardous to your progress. That‘s why this book is based on both science and real-world results. We 
should never deny or ignore the results of well-performed research. We should never dismiss the 
results of our own experience, either, when results are the one thing that counts the most. At some 
point in your journey, you have to start experimenting, measuring progress, and drawing conclusions 
based on your own results. 
Some of the nutrition and training methods used by bodybuilders are controversial, and throughout 
this book I‘ll be sure to point that out wherever that‘s the case. Research results may be conflicting or 
there‘s not much evidence either way. But if you wait for enough studies to validate every nutrition 
and training technique that has already been proven effective out in the trenches, you could be waiting 
a long time. When it comes to body transformation, physique athletes are often ahead of the science, 
and the results they‘ve achieved prove it. 
7. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is simple, but it’s not easy. 

================================================================================
Burning fat is simple, but that doesn‘t mean it‘s easy. ―Simple‖ means uncomplicated. ―Easy‖ implies 
little or no effort. Losing weight is a simple matter of achieving a calorie deficit. There‘s nothing 
complicated about that. But balancing energy in and energy out in a modern, sedentary, temptation-
filled environment is easier said than done. 
Fat loss isn‘t always easy. Most diet experts won‘t admit it, because ―effortless and overnight‖ is 
marketable. ―Hard work‖ scares people away. But hard work is the only way anyone accomplishes 
great things. Everything worth having in life has a price attached to it. Legendary Green Bay Packers 
coach Vince Lombardi put it best when he said, ―The dictionary is the only place success comes 
before work. Hard work is the price we must all pay for success.‖ 
8. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle pursues the truth, not the fads. 
I launched my first website in 1999. Since then I‘ve shared my hard work and no-gimmicks 
philosophy with millions of visitors. To this day, my Burn the Fat websites and social communities 
are still growing. That kind of longevity not only requires results, it also requires honesty. I make my 
living from the health-and-fitness business, but I will go broke and starve to death before I ―sell out‖ 
or compromise my values. Believe me, I‘ve had no shortage of opportunity. Let me tell you a quick 
story. 
Years ago, the editor of a major fitness magazine contacted me with a proposition. He was so 
impressed with my online articles that he wanted to hire me. He offered me $1,000 to interview some 
of the top supplement gurus, including the CEO of one of the largest nutrition companies in the world. 
My assignment was to write a two-page article about the latest developments with a popular but 
controversial product. A thousand bucks is temptingly good pay for one short article, but then he 
threw in the catch: Because of his magazine‘s relationship with the supplement company, he told me I 
couldn‘t write anything bad about the product. In fact, I had to put a ―positive spin‖ on it. I turned it 
down. It went against everything I believed in about truth and objectivity. 
By selectively quoting research, magazines can promote a new diet pill or exercise fad every month 
and make it look like a breakthrough every time. By putting product information into articles, the 
claims sound more legitimate, and the advertisements feed off the articles. That makes magazines—
online or in print—the perfect vehicles for selling supplements. Publishers see it as the ultimate 
business model. I see it as a conflict of interest. That‘s why, years ago, I made a public pledge that I 
would never go into the supplement business or use my books or websites to sell them. 
As you read Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, you can rest assured that there‘s no hidden agenda. I‘m 
not here to sell you magic weight-loss potions or the latest training trend; I‘m here to sell you on 
getting strong, healthy, and fit. 
9. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is about real food, not supplements. 
It‘s tempting to think that all you need to solve a body fat problem is a fat-burning pill or diet drink. 
The supplement companies certainly want you to believe that. The truth is that training and good 
nutrition from whole foods are all you‘ll ever need. Protein shakes and meal replacement products are 
sometimes helpful, but they have no magical fat-reducing properties. They‘re essentially just 
powdered food. 
The majority of so-called fat-burning products available over-the-counter are worthless and have no 
scientific evidence validating their use. Pills that rely on stimulants, thermogenics, or appetite 
suppressants might help a little, but they aren‘t as effective as many advertisements claim, and there 
are potential dangers if they‘re abused. 

================================================================================
Most people want overnight health cures and fat-loss miracles. But those are fantasies. If there 
really were a magic pill that burned off fat without work, there wouldn‘t be millions of overweight 
people in the world today. If you want to see a real miracle, try training hard and eating real food 
consistently for a few months. The sooner you accept this reality, the sooner you‘ll be the proud owner 
of a lean body. 
10. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is custom-tailored, not one-size-fits-all. 
Some nutrition laws are universal: They apply to everyone. But after you‘ve mastered the 
fundamentals, you‘ll need to customize your plan to fit your goals and your body type. No two people 
are exactly alike. Each person has a metabolism, digestive system, hormonal profile, sugar tolerance, 
and body structure as unique as their fingerprint. That‘s why one-size-fits-all diet or exercise plans 
almost always fail. 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle identifies all these differences and accommodates them. You‘ll also 
have enough flexibility to adjust your nutrition and training to fit your schedule and satisfy your 
personal tastes. Customizing your program enables you to do the very best you can with what Mother 
Nature gave you. 
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is an amazingly thorough and detailed program. It covers all four 
elements of the fat-burning equation: 
1.  Mental training 
2.  Nutrition 
3.  Cardio training 
4.  Weight training 
It‘s a simple formula, but don‘t underestimate its power. Almost everyone is missing at least one of 
these crucial elements, and many are missing two or even three. Only when all four are in place will 
you fully maximize your potential. 
This book was designed to be the definitive guide to body transformation. Thousands of readers 
already call this their ―fat-loss bible‖ and come back to it over and over again as a reference manual. 
The information came from thousands of academic and real-world sources. I‘ve updated this book 
based on the latest research, but the core concepts are principle-based, so they‘ll never go out of date. 
Popular trends always change, but fundamentals never do. 
Some of this information may be new or surprising to you, depending on your current level of 
knowledge. Most of it, however, is so simple and straightforward, you‘ll wonder why it didn‘t ―click‖ 
for you sooner. What‘s different about Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is the way all the isolated bits 
and pieces you may have heard before are pulled together into a single comprehensive and organized 
system. 
Throughout the rest of the book, I‘ll take you through all the nutrition and training principles you 
need to know to get the results you want. I‘ll show you what to do and give you just enough science so 
you know why you‘re doing it. You‘ll get all the essentials first. We‘ll finish with advanced strategies 

================================================================================
to break plateaus and accelerate your results. You‘ll be able to customize everything to match your 
goals, suit your tastes, and fit your lifestyle. 
At first, it may seem like a lot to take in, but it all comes together in the end, and the payoff is 
extraordinary. By the time you reach the final chapters, you‘ll experience a sort of ―nutritional 
enlightenment.‖ But you can‘t reach that state of knowledge and understanding without first passing 
through the initial learning curve. My goal is to shorten that curve for you, inspire you, and help you 
reach your goals as fast as possible. 
If you want to get started quickly, you can. Chapter 14 contains the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle 
eating plan, sample meal plans, and food lists, making that an excellent ―nutrition quick start guide.‖ 
Chapters 15, 16, and 17 contain the workout, including the 28-day training plan. Jump in! 
It‘s especially important however, that you begin with the first element: mental training. If you‘ve 
ever sabotaged yourself or fallen off the fitness wagon before, the reason always comes back to lack of 
focus and an untrained mind. Do the goal-setting exercises in Chapter 6 before going on to the other 
three elements. Hundreds if not thousands of readers have told me over the years that what they 
learned in that chapter about mental training made a bigger difference in their results than anything 
they‘d ever read in a diet or fitness book before. 
NOW GET STARTED! 
As you read, remember that knowledge unused is worthless; only knowledge applied is power, so 
begin using what you learn immediately. Don‘t obsess over getting the whole program perfect from 
day one. As you learn new tips on each page, put them to use. Start today! Start with your very next 
meal! I like the way the late, great motivational speaker Jim Rohn said it: ―Don‘t let your learning lead 
to knowledge, let your learning lead to action.‖ 
One more thing: You don‘t have to do this alone. Support is a major key to motivation and long-
term success. You can connect with me and hundreds of thousands of Burn the Fat fans on our social 
media sites including www.facebook.com/burnthefat and twitter.com/tomvenuto. You can get the free 
tools and resources that go with this book at www.BurnTheFatFeedTheMuscle.com. And if you want

CHAPTER 2 
Why Diets Fail and Why This Plan Won’t 
Dieting is not effective in controlling weight. You can get a temporary weight loss with a diet, but 
each scheme ultimately gives way to weight gain, and subsequent losses become increasingly difficult. 
Worst of all, you get progressively fatter on less food. Dieting actually makes you fatter! 
—Dr. Lawrence E. Lamb, author of The Weighting Game: The Truth About Weight Control 
WHY DIETS NEVER WORK 
In the first part of this chapter, you‘ll learn why most people struggle to lose weight and keep it off 
long term. You‘ll also realize why most diets are fundamentally flawed and doomed to fail before 
they‘re even started. All it takes is a basic understanding of metabolism, hormones, and your body‘s 
remarkable protective mechanism known as the ―starvation response.‖ In the second part, you‘ll 
discover six strategies that guarantee you‘ll burn off fat forever without starving yourself or giving up 
your favorite foods. All of these strategies are built right into the foundations of the program. By 
following the training and eating plans from this book, you‘ll automatically be using every one of 
these strategies and setting yourself up to succeed. 
By definition, a diet is the temporary and unsustainable restriction of food or calories. Most popular 
weight-loss diets call for very low calories: 800 to 1,200 per day or less for women and 1,500 to 1,800 
per day or less for men is not uncommon. When you cut calories to these extremes, you will lose 
weight, at least for a little while. However, there are two major problems with this approach. 
The first is that restrictive low-calorie diets are almost impossible to follow for long, so the weight 
loss almost never lasts. According to research by the National Weight Control Registry, 95 percent of 
people who lose weight on conventional diet programs eventually regain it. The second problem is 
that most people neglect proper training while dieting, so much of the weight they lose is lean body 
mass, not fat. Best-case scenario: A dieter somehow keeps the weight off, but they end up a smaller 
version of their old self; they haven‘t reshaped their body nor become any stronger, healthier, or fitter. 
If your only interest is weight loss and you don‘t care where the weight comes from, how long it 
stays off, or whether you harm yourself in the process, then you could say, ―All diets work.‖ If your 
goal is to shed fat permanently and safely without losing muscle, it‘s truer to say, ―Diets never work.‖ 
There are more diet programs today than ever, yet there‘s more obesity than ever. According to the 
National Institutes of Health, more than 133 million people in the United States are overweight; that‘s 
64 percent of the adult population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the 
number of clinically obese people increased in the United States from one in eight in 1991 to nearly 
one in five in 1999. Today, 63 million, or one in three adults, are clinically obese (at least 30 percent 
over their ideal weight), which means they‘re at risk for over 30 health problems associated with 
excess body fat. 
You see diet ads everywhere proclaiming that the holy grail of weight loss has been found, but the 
statistics don‘t lie: The way most people are dieting for weight loss doesn‘t work—and there are 
scientific reasons why. 

================================================================================
WHY THE CALORIE MATH DOESN’T ADD UP 
The law of energy balance says that if you eat fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. 
There are 3,500 calories in a pound of stored body fat. If you cut 1,000 calories per day from your 
daily maintenance level, it adds up to a 7,000-calorie deficit in one week and—on paper—should 
produce weight loss of two pounds every week. Simple math, right? Not exactly. 
When you introduce a calorie deficit at the start of a diet, you‘ll lose weight, but it doesn‘t take long 
before weight loss slows and sometimes stops completely. Why does this happen? With a 1,000-
calorie deficit below your initial daily maintenance level, why don‘t you lose 50 pounds in 25 weeks 
or 100 pounds in 50 weeks? The answer is simple: The math equation changes! 
The number of calories you burn initially may not be the same six months or a year later. In other 
words, energy balance is dynamic. A calorie deficit is a moving target. When you lose body weight, 
you need fewer calories to support your smaller body. When you drop your calories, you also tend to 
drop your activity levels, sometimes unconsciously. But most people fail to adjust their calorie intake 
to match their lower energy needs. 
In addition, most people don‘t train properly to maintain muscle (or they don‘t work out at all). 
Instead, they try to starve the fat. That only makes it worse, because your body has a complex and 
redundant series of defense mechanisms to protect you from starvation and maintain a stable weight. 
UNDERSTANDING THE STARVATION RESPONSE 
If our ancient ancestors wanted to eat, they had to forage for food, grow it, or kill it (which required a 
lot of physical activity, something modern humans don‘t get). Ancient humans may not have even 
known when their next meal was coming. During the lean times, they may have eaten substantial 
meals only after successful hunts. Scientists theorize that adaptive mechanisms, collectively known as 
the ―starvation response,‖ developed to ensure survival of the species. 
You can survive a long time without food. You may have heard stories about people lost in the 
wilderness for weeks with no food, or confined in a prisoner of war camp for years with little food. 
There are case studies of lean individuals on hunger strikes surviving up to two months without food 
and obese individuals surviving 200 days or longer without eating. Two things make it possible to 
survive so long under starvation and semi-starvation conditions: 
1.  Your body can easily and efficiently store energy as fat when food is plentiful, as insurance 
against future shortages. 
2. Your body can decrease energy expenditure and increase food-seeking behaviors when body fat 
stores are running low and food is scarce. 
YOUR BODY CAN’T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIETING 
AND STARVATION 
During long periods of starvation, your body slowly feeds off itself for energy, burning through fat 
stores, then muscle and eventually vital organs. If you continued to burn calories at your normal rate 
while your food intake fell far below normal, you would quickly exhaust your reserves of stored 
energy and die soon after your food supply was cut off. Your body‘s starvation response keeps you 
alive longer. 

================================================================================
This type of adaptation was a blessing to our ancestors during times of famine. But in modern, 
affluent societies today, this same life-preserving mechanism can work against you when you‘re trying 
to lose fat. When your body senses calorie deprivation, your survival responses kick in, even though a 
diet is not a life or death situation. Your body tells itself, ―It looks like this is all the food you‘re 
getting for a while, so you‘d better stop burning so many calories, start conserving your energy, and 
increase the drive for finding food.‖ 
Whether a real famine or a low-calorie diet, your body can‘t tell the difference. Either way, if the 
calorie shortage is severe and prolonged, there are consequences, and they‘re hardwired into your 
genes. The only way to avoid them is to avoid severe calorie shortages! 
THE TOP 10 REASONS TO AVOID EXTREME LOW-CALORIE 
DIETS 
The negative side effects of very low-calorie dieting can be physiological or psychological in nature—
usually both. They include increases in hunger and food-seeking behavior, drops in energy or activity 
level, loss of lean body mass, decreases in metabolic rate, and problems with hormones. If you‘re not 
aware of them, these forces conspire to get you burning less, eating more, and relapsing when the diet 
is over. 
1. Diets increase hunger and cravings. 
The first thing you notice during a calorie shortage is the hunger. You should expect a little hunger 
when you‘re in a calorie deficit, but with extreme diets you become ravenous. It‘s almost impossible 
to stay on a diet when you‘re battling voracious hunger and all you can think about is food. More than 
a dozen hormones influence how hungry or full you feel. The urge to eat can also be psychological or 
environmental. You tend to want what you can‘t have, so if your diet is too low in calories or it sets 
too many rules about what you can‘t eat, the feeling of deprivation triggers cravings and binges. It‘s 
worse when you‘re surrounded by temptations and eating cues all day long. 
2. Diets slow down your metabolic rate. 
Your basal metabolic rate is the number of calories you burn at rest every day. When you lose a lot of 
weight, you burn fewer calories simply because you have a smaller body. But calorie restriction 
causes your metabolic rate to decrease even more than a drop in body weight would predict. This is 
known as ―adaptive thermogenesis‖ and it‘s one of the reasons why progress slows over time and why 
it‘s harder for most people to lose those last stubborn 10 to 15 pounds. 
3. Diets may increase the risk of muscle loss. 
When your body is being starved, it looks for ways to conserve energy. Since muscle burns calories 
and muscle is extra weight you have to lug around, getting rid of it is an easy way for your body to 
burn less. Lean people who already have low body fat are more likely to lose muscle than overweight 
people, but it can happen to anyone. Dieting without resistance training can cause 30 percent to 50 
percent of your weight loss to come from lean tissue. The risk of muscle loss is higher if your protein 
intake is too low. Even when you‘re lifting weights and eating enough protein, if your diet is too 
severe, some of the lost weight can still come from muscle. 

================================================================================
4. Diets decrease non-exercise activity thermogenesis. 
Non-exercise activity thermogenesis, also known as NEAT, is the scientific name for all your physical 
activity throughout the day, excluding formal exercise. This includes all the calories you burn from 
casual walking, shopping, yard work, housework, standing, pacing, and even little things like chewing, 
changing posture, and fidgeting. Obviously, most of those activities don‘t burn many calories 
individually, but over time the total burn from NEAT can really add up. Studies by Dr. James A. 
Levine at the Mayo Clinic found that when you cut calories, your NEAT level drops. Many people 
already know that low-calorie diets make them lethargic. If they make it to the gym at all, they work 
out with less gusto. Unless you consciously counter this tendency by keeping yourself active, your 
weight loss will slow down automatically as you keep dieting. 
5. Diets decrease your energy and work capacity. 
Some people do better than others when training under less-than-ideal conditions. But as a general 
rule, low-calorie diets are not conducive to good workouts or an active lifestyle. One of the first signs 
of undernutrition is loss of energy and the ability to sustain intense training. Without enough fuel 
coming in, you‘ll fatigue faster, your strength will suffer, your performance will plummet, and your 
results will be compromised. To maximize your fat burning and build your best body, you must be 
able to train hard. If you‘re hardly eating, you can hardly train. 
6. Diets decrease thyroid hormones. 
Low-calorie diets can have a major impact on hormone levels. Since thyroid levels help regulate your 
metabolic rate, maintaining thyroid function is important for successful fat loss as well as overall 
health. Endocrinologists have measured reductions in triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels 
as quickly as one week after starting a very low-calorie diet, even before there is a decrease in body 
weight. As the severity and duration of the diet increases, the risk of negative effects increases. You 
need that calorie deficit to burn fat, but cutting calories too far—especially when you slash the 
carbohydrates too low—can wreak havoc with the very hormones you need working at peak 
efficiency. 
7. Diets decrease the hormone leptin. 
Leptin is a hormone produced primarily in your fat cells that also plays a major role in regulating 
metabolism and body weight. When you‘re well fed and your body fat levels are stable, leptin sends a 
signal to your brain saying, ―Everything is okay in the food supply and fat storage department.‖ If 
food intake or body fat stores go down, your leptin levels drop. When leptin is low, it signals your 
brain that body fat reserves are declining and starvation is impending. This is why leptin is often 
called the ―anti-starvation hormone,‖ and it may be the hormone that triggers the entire cascade of 
starvation responses, from increased hunger to reduced metabolism. 
8. Diets increase the stress hormone cortisol. 
Cortisol is a catabolic (muscle-wasting) hormone produced by your adrenal glands in response to 
various types of physical and mental stress, including dieting. Research has shown that cortisol is 
inversely related to calorie levels. What about those pills that claim to suppress high cortisol levels 
and help burn fat? Don‘t bother. Even if they help reduce high cortisol, a pill is only a Band-Aid. If 

================================================================================
starvation dieting and other stressors are causing a hormonal imbalance, you need to address those 
issues rather than trying to treat the symptoms. 
9. Diets decrease testosterone. 
Testosterone also takes a hit when you cut calories too much. This makes perfect sense from an 
evolutionary point of view because if you can‘t even feed yourself, you‘re in no condition to bear and 
feed offspring, are you? In a study from the Journal of Applied Physiology, Army Rangers who were 
fed only 1,000 calories a day under conditions of stress, sustained workload, and inadequate sleep 
experienced a drop in testosterone that approached castration levels. (Make note: Sleep deprivation, 
stress, and a low-calorie diet are a really bad combination.) Most research says that a conservative 
calorie cut of 20 percent below maintenance level won‘t affect testosterone. As the calorie cuts get 
more aggressive and your body gets leaner and leaner, low testosterone becomes more of a concern. 
10. Diets increase the chance of weight regain. 
Almost everyone loses weight at the beginning, but later on, when the weight loss slows down and the 
hunger pangs intensify, most people give up. Even worse, they end their diet with a binge. That‘s bad 
news, because dieting can prime your body to regain weight more easily and leave you fatter than 
when you started. Eventually, you get sucked in by the newest fad diet, and the yo-yo diet cycle starts 
all over again. This up-and-down pattern of weight loss and regain is known as weight cycling, and 
many people suffer through this for years or even their entire lifetime. Not only is it unhealthy, but 
with each cycle your metabolism becomes less efficient and you may actually get fatter more easily 
while eating less food than before. 
WHY DIETING CAN ACTUALLY MAKE YOU FATTER 
You can now see the great irony in the weight-loss world today: Dieting can actually make you fatter 
in the long term. Because most of the best-selling popular diets today promote very low calories and 
ignore proper training, they‘re actually causing the very problem they claim to cure. 
Let‘s see how these biological and psychological responses to extreme diets affect real-world 
results. Chris is a typical dieter with a goal of losing 20 pounds. 
Before the Diet 
200 pounds body weight 
36 pounds (18 percent) body fat 
164 pounds lean body mass 
Like most people, Chris was told that the best way to lose body fat is to slash calories, so he went 
on a 1,500-calorie-per-day diet (which is semi-starvation for an active man of his size). In the first 
week he lost 5 pounds and was very happy, even though he suspected a pound or two was water 
weight. The second week he lost 4 pounds. In weeks three through six he lost 3 pounds per week for a 
grand total of 21 pounds. 
Chris now weighs 179 pounds and he lost weight steadily without hitting a plateau (although the 
weight loss did slow down). Judging by the scale alone, he‘s reached his goal. If we look at the 
numbers more closely, however, we find that he hasn‘t been so successful after all. 

================================================================================
After the Diet 
179 pounds body weight 
26.5 pounds (14.8 percent) body fat 
152.5 pounds lean body mass 
21 pounds weight loss 
9.5 pounds fat loss 
11.5 pounds lean body mass loss 
By rating his results in terms of body composition instead of scale weight, it becomes clear how 
Chris has failed. Fifty-five percent of his weight loss came from lean body mass. The drop in lean 
body mass decreased his metabolism, so he is now burning fewer calories each day than when he 
started. This has set him up for a relapse. 
Even if he doesn‘t give in to hunger and binge, but simply goes back to the way he used to eat, his 
body no longer burns calories as efficiently as before. Therefore, the number of calories that used to 
maintain his weight now makes him gain weight. As the weeks pass, the weight slowly creeps back on 
until he finally regains all the fat he lost. 
Six Weeks After the Diet Ends 
200 pounds body weight 
41.1 pounds (20.5 percent) body fat 
158.9 pounds lean body mass 
Chris now weighs the same as when he started, with one difference: He has less muscle, more fat, 
and a slower metabolic rate than when he began. He has ―damaged‖ his metabolism and it will now be 
harder to lose weight than before. 
The same thing happens to women. The difference is that women have naturally higher body fat 
levels, lower total body mass, lower calorie needs, and different hormonal concerns. It‘s not a stretch 
to say that fat loss is harder for women than men, and women are more susceptible to metabolic 
damage than men. 
SIX STRATEGIES TO BURN THE FAT FOREVER, WITHOUT 
DIETING OR DEPRIVING YOURSELF 
The odds of you losing fat permanently with traditional low-calorie diets are stacked against you 
biologically, psychologically, and environmentally. It sounds grim, but the good news is you can 
bypass these problems if you avoid the typical diet mentality. Instead, do what bodybuilders and 
fitness models do. Let me introduce you to six no-diet strategies you can use to burn the fat and keep it 
off for good. These are the secrets of the leanest people in the world. Even if you‘ve used starvation 
diets in the past and you‘re afraid you‘ve caused damage from previous dieting mistakes, don‘t worry. 
These same guidelines will help you bring your metabolism back up to speed. 
1. Think ―habit‖ not ―diet.‖ 
You can‘t achieve permanent fat loss by going on and off diets, especially if you‘re always hopping 
from one diet trend to the next. You achieve permanent results by adopting new habits that you can 

================================================================================
maintain for the rest of your life. These habits must include the way you eat, the way you think, and 
the way you move. 
Good habits aren‘t easy to form, but once they‘re established, they‘re just as hard to break as the 
bad ones. Motivational writer Orison Swett Marden put it this way: ―The beginning of a habit is like 
an invisible thread, but every time we repeat the act we strengthen the strand, add to it another 
filament, until it becomes a great cable and binds us irrevocably.‖ 
Nature abhors a vacuum. If you simply remove a bad habit, it leaves a void begging to be filled by 
another one. An old proverb says that a negative habit can most easily be driven out by a positive 
habit, just as a nail can be driven out by another nail. The best way to get rid of undesirable habits 
such as drinking soda, spending hours on the couch watching TV, and thinking like a pessimist is by 
replacing them with new ones, rather than trying to overcome them with willpower. Throughout this 
book, you‘ll hear many ideas for ―out with the old and in with the new.‖ 
Initially, there‘s a period where starting the new habit will feel uncomfortable. Be patient: 
Everything is difficult in the beginning. Accept the challenge! For a new behavior to become 
entrenched in your nervous system, it could take months. However, the roots of nutrition and exercise 
habits can be formed in less than 28 days. That‘s why it‘s so important to give 100 percent effort and 
commitment in the beginning while you build up momentum. After those four weeks, you‘ll be leaner 
and on your way to making your new habits as effortless and natural as brushing your teeth or taking a 
shower. 
2. Maintain your muscle. 
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is well known for saying that rule number one in making money is 
never lose money. It‘s the same with making a body transformation. A simple strategy for permanent 
fat loss is never lose muscle. Muscle is your fat-burning secret weapon. Muscle is your metabolic 
furnace. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn at rest as well as during exercise. 
Obviously, weight training is a huge factor when it comes to keeping your muscle while you‘re 
shedding the fat, so when you get to the chapter on training, read it carefully and take it seriously. On 
the nutrition side, the biggest keys to maintaining muscle include getting enough protein and being 
conservative with calorie cuts. 
3. Cut calories conservatively. 
You must have a calorie deficit to burn body fat, but most people cut calories much too fast. Your 
body can‘t be forced to lose fat more quickly than nature intended; you must coax it. The smartest, 
safest, and healthiest approach for permanent fat loss is to start with a small deficit, add exercise, then 
continue to cut calories if necessary as your weekly results dictate. Do it slowly and progressively in 
stages, not all at once. 
In Chapter 7, I‘ll show you the exact formulas to calculate your personal calorie requirements to 
maintain your weight, burn fat, and build muscle. If you don‘t like crunching numbers, I‘ll also show 
you the quick start shortcuts as well. Here‘s what you need to know now—and this should be music to 
your ears: If you eat the right foods and do the type of training I recommend, you‘ll be able to eat a lot 
more than you think and the fat will still melt away. Welcome to Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, good-
bye to starvation diets. 
4. Burn the fat, don’t starve the fat. 
There‘s more than one way to create a calorie deficit. You can decrease your calorie intake from food 
or increase the calories you burn from training and other activity. Unless you‘re physically unable to 

================================================================================
exercise, a combination of both is ideal. Using exercise to maintain muscle and expand your calorie 
deficit has huge advantages over dieting alone. 
Most people are too focused on cutting calories and removing foods while training little or not at 
all. With the right kind of training, you build muscle, increase your strength, reshape your body and 
boost your metabolism. Plus you can eat more and still keep losing fat. As paradoxical as it might 
sound, the fastest way to transform your body is to eat more and burn more. You eat more to provide 
energy, nutrients, and building material. You burn more to stoke metabolism, build muscle, gain 
strength, and improve fitness. 
Why deprive yourself by eating less when you can eat more and fire up your metabolic furnace? All 
you need to do is add the right kind of training on top of a sensible nutrition program. Compared to 
dieting alone, the results you get from combining cardio, weight training, and nutritious eating to 
achieve a specific goal are nothing short of miraculous. 
Here are some reasons why training (weight training and cardio training combined) is superior to 
dieting for losing body fat: 
Training (burn more) 
Dieting (eat less) 
Raises your metabolic rate 
Slows down your metabolic rate 
Creates a caloric deficit without triggering the starvation response 
Triggers the starvation response 
Provides countless health benefits 
May be harmful to your health 
Builds and maintains lean body mass 
Promotes loss of lean body mass 
Increases fat-burning hormones 
Decreases fat-burning hormones 
5. Use the calorie ―cycling‖ method (don’t stay in a deficit too long). 
You probably know at least one person who always seems to be on a diet. While these ―professional 
dieters‖ may lose some weight in the beginning, they never seem to reach their long-term goals. 
They‘re always hitting plateaus and struggling to avoid regaining the weight they lost. God bless 
them—they never give up! Unfortunately, that‘s part of the problem. Each time they plateau or see the 
scale start creeping up again, they either panic and cut calories more, or they try all over again with 
the latest crash ―diet of the month.‖ 
When your fat loss slows down or you hit a fat-loss plateau the first time, dropping calories is 
usually the right decision. But if your calories are already low and you‘ve been dieting for a long time, 
cutting calories more can dig you into a deeper metabolic rut. It seems counterintuitive, but sometimes 
the best thing you can do to ―reset‖ a sluggish metabolism is to eat more before going back to the 
caloric deficit again. 
Inserting occasional higher-calorie days between lower-calorie days is a simple technique that gives 
you a nice physical and psychological break from days or weeks of continuous deficit. After months 

================================================================================
of lower-calorie eating, a full week or two of higher-calorie (maintenance level) eating optimizes your 
hormones and restokes your metabolic fire. 
This method of raising your calories periodically instead of staying low all the time is known as the 
―cycling‖ or ―zigzagging‖ method. The bigger your caloric deficit has been, the longer you‘ve been in 
it, and the lower your body fat becomes, the more important it is to take these diet breaks or ―re-
feeding‖ days. This plan will teach you how to know when your body needs this extra surge of 
calories to keep burning fat. 
6. Lose weight at the right rate for you. 
Most people sell themselves short and greatly underestimate the caliber of physique they can develop 
over time. I‘ve seen people go from obesity to the fitness stage in one year; no one even recognized 
them with their new bodies. In the short term, however, most people are impatient and expect too 
much weight loss too fast, so it‘s important to set weekly goals thoughtfully. 
Setting lots of short-term goals is crucial. But if you set them so high that they‘re physiologically 
impossible to achieve in the time frame you‘ve chosen, and your results fall short of your 
expectations, you end up disappointed. Even if you set weekly weight-loss goals too high and actually 
do reach them, it doesn‘t always mean victory. Recall Chris the dieter, who lost 21 pounds in six 
weeks but half the weight was lean body mass, and he regained every pound of fat and more. 
People with high body fat levels can usually drop fat faster without as many negative side effects. 
People who are already lean need to lose more slowly, or the risks—especially muscle loss—are 
greater. Women lose more slowly as well, especially short or small-framed women, because they have 
lower metabolisms to start with. ―Slow burners‖ should celebrate every pound of progress, be patient, 
and keep in mind that old fable of the tortoise and the hare. 
The best way to burn fat and keep it off for good, without losing muscle, and without making your 
life miserable, is to lose weight at the right rate for you. Many fitness experts recommend two pounds 
per week. That‘s a sensible general guideline, but it could be too fast for a petite female and too slow 
for a big man. Dropping 1 percent of total body weight each week is a safe and realistic goal that‘s 
customized for each individual. That would be only 1.5 pounds per week for someone at 150 pounds 
and 3 pounds per week for someone at 300 pounds. 
Your mileage may vary. Most important of all: You will track your progress as you make this 
journey. You‘ll learn to measure your body fat and lean body mass. And you‘ll always be on target if 
you give your body the nutrition it needs because the weight you lose will be pure body fat. 
PUT THESE STRATEGIES TO WORK AND YOU’LL NEVER DIET 
AGAIN 
You‘ll learn more about how to implement these no-diet nutrition strategies in the upcoming chapters, 
and of course you‘ll find the ultimate lean-muscle training program in Chapter 17. The best part is 
everything can be custom tailored for your goals, your metabolism, your schedule, your lifestyle, and 
your body type. It‘s all about you, and in the next chapter you‘ll find out just how important that is.

CHAPTER 3 
Understanding Your Body Type 
and Customizing Your Plan 
Some people are born with the propensity to become fatter than others. There are naturally skinny 
ectomorphs and naturally fatter endomorphs. Some individuals are given more fat cells by heredity, 
some fewer. But the set point is affected by environment and behavior as well as heredity. You can 
vary your set point considerably depending on what and how you eat, as well as what kind and how 
much exercise you do. 
—Neal Spruce, author, speaker, bodybuilder 
THE GENETIC BELL CURVE 
There are seven billion people on our planet today and no two are exactly the same. Just as individuals 
are born with various hair, eye, and skin colors, each person also inherits different physical and 
metabolic traits that influence how easily they can build muscle and shed fat. One of the greatest 
secrets of body transformation is to ―know thyself‖ and customize your training, nutrition, and 
lifestyle to suit your body type instead of blindly following someone else. Understanding the 
uniqueness of your body also helps you set expectations as well as keeps you motivated when the 
going gets tough. 
Dr. Michael Colgan, author of Optimum Sports Nutrition: Your Competitive Edge once said, ―As a 
part of biochemical individuality, people differ widely in their inherited tendencies to accumulate fat.‖ 
Many people who struggle to lose weight would certainly agree. In physique and strength sports, 
genetically gifted people seem simply to touch the weights and their muscles get bigger and stronger. 
When I was a beginner in bodybuilding, seeing other people get results more easily than I did was 
always frustrating. I was eating perfectly while pushing, working, struggling, and straining with every 
bit of energy I could muster for every ounce of muscle I could gain. Then some ―genetic freaks‖ 
would come along and pass right by me without breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury, it seemed 
like they were breaking every training and nutrition rule in the book. When some of them took steroids 
on top of their hereditary gifts, their muscle growth exploded! I learned quickly that a genetic superior 
on drugs is not a good role model. 
The law of averages dictates that the distribution of body types is statistically predictable based on 
percentiles. This phenomenon, known as the genetic bell curve, is similar to the distribution of grades 
among students. About 60 percent of students will receive passing grades (B‘s, C‘s, and D‘s), 20 
percent will fail, and 20 percent will get A‘s. 
With regard to body type, most people (about 60 percent of the population by my estimate) are 
genetically average. If you fall into this middle category, you‘ll respond favorably and predictably to 
any sensible plan. All it takes is following a well-designed training program and covering all the 
nutritional bases, including calories, protein, carbs, fats, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and water. 
The 20 percent of the population on the right side of the curve represents those genetically above 
average. This lucky group sheds fat quickly and easily, even if their nutrition and training aren‘t 

================================================================================
perfect. They have more leeway and can get away with fewer workouts and more cheat days. On the 
extreme right edge of the curve, you have the outliers who appear to eat chocolate and doughnuts all 
day long, hardly work out, yet have six-pack abs. These are the genetically gifted—or the genetic 
freaks, as I endearingly call them. 
The remaining 20 percent, on the left side of the curve, are the genetically below average. These 
people have a more difficult time shedding fat and need to work harder than others. Getting results 
may require a stricter nutrition program, more disciplined training, and a lot more patience. The 
farther to the left side of the genetic bell curve you are, the more challenging it is to get lean and 
muscular. 
You can‘t deny that it‘s easier for some people to burn fat and build muscle than it is for others. Nor 
should you. The best approach is ―realistic optimism.‖ Not everyone has the genetic raw material to 
become a Mr. Universe, a fitness model, an Olympic sprinter, or an elite marathon runner. However, 
everyone can improve their fitness and physique above and beyond where it is today. Your goal 
should be to achieve your personal best while avoiding comparisons to others who have different 
genetics than you. The information in this chapter will help you do it. 
First we‘ll look at genetic variability and what ―good genetics‖ really means. You‘ll then learn 
about the three basic body types and how to identify which one you are. You‘ll also get action 
strategies to customize your plan to suit your type. We‘ll wrap up with some advice on mind-set, 
because when it comes to how genetics affect your health and your body, your attitude can make you 
or break you. 
THE TEN MAJOR GENETIC VARIABLES THAT AFFECT FAT 
LOSS, MUSCLE GROWTH, STRENGTH, AND ATHLETIC ABILITY 
A good place to start is to answer the basic question: Why is burning fat and building muscle easier 
for some than for others? There are ten major genetic variables that affect your ability to burn fat, 
build muscle, increase strength, and reach high levels of athletic achievement. Studying these 
variables will help you understand how nutrition and training can affect you differently than other 
people. 
1. Basal metabolic rate 
Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy you burn at rest every day just to maintain 
normal body functions such as breathing, circulation, digestion, and so on. The average male has a 
BMR of about 1,900 calories and the average female 1,400 calories. (You will use the formulas in 
Chapter 7 to calculate your customized BMR numbers.) Naturally, BMR can vary a lot based on body 
size and lean mass. But BMR can also vary between people who weigh the same because of 
differences in thyroid, organ mass, and other genetic factors. Some people are like cars that idle fast: 
They burn more fuel even while sitting still. When these people are highly active—and they usually 
are—they‘re like calorie-burning machines. 
2. Number of fat cells 
Some people are born with more fat cells than others, and women have more fat cells than men. 
Obviously, the person with more sites for fat storage has a disadvantage. A healthy, normal weight 
adult has between 25 billion to 30 billion fat cells. A typical overweight adult has about 75 billion fat 
cells, but with severe obesity, that number can be as high as 250 billion to 500 billion! 

================================================================================
Fat cells can increase in both size and number. They can multiply during rapid weight gain, which 
is another reason to keep your calories in check and your weight under control. Fat cell number cannot 
be decreased except through liposuction, and that can be expensive, painful, and risky. (It‘s also 
nothing more than cosmetic surgery, not a permanent solution, because new fat cells can be formed so 
easily.) The good news is, with the right nutrition and training, even someone with a large number of 
fat cells can shrink them all and get dramatically leaner. 
3. Number of muscle fibers 
Like fat cells, you were born with a predetermined number of muscle fibers. Muscle fibers can get 
larger, in a process called hypertrophy, or they can get smaller, or atrophy. Unlike fat cells, muscle 
cells can‘t multiply in number. Hyperplasia, the process of splitting existing muscle fibers into new 
fibers, has been hypothesized but never proven in humans. This means that if you were born with a 
large number of muscle fibers, you have a greater potential to grow muscle than someone with fewer 
fibers. 
4. Muscle fiber type 
There are also different types of muscle fibers. Some are suited to endurance work (slow-twitch fibers) 
while others are suited for strength, power, and explosive work (fast-twitch fibers). The differences in 
each person‘s ratio of muscle fibers may explain why some people make better endurance athletes 
while others gravitate to strength or power sports. 
5. Muscle insertions 
The muscles insert onto the same bones in all humans; however, the exact point of insertion varies. 
Even a tiny difference in insertion points can create large increases in mechanical advantage. This 
partly explains why certain people are naturally stronger than others: They have better leverage 
because of their muscle insertion points. 
6. Limb length 
Some people are born with long legs and long arms, others with short legs and short arms. Limb 
length can affect your body‘s shape and symmetry. It can also influence your strength, athletic 
prowess, and ability to gain muscle. Long limbs mean long levers, which can create a mechanical 
disadvantage when performing certain exercises. Some people are born with fantastic leverage and 
that‘s why they become naturally strong. 
7. Joint size 
Joint size affects the way your body is shaped, but being ―big-boned‖ has nothing to do with body fat 
or your ability to burn it. You can measure joint circumference with a tape measure. A simple test is to 
wrap your hand around your opposite wrist. If your thumb and middle finger overlap, you are small 
jointed (usually 6- to 7-inch wrists); if your thumb and middle finger touch, you are medium jointed 
(usually 7- to 8-inch wrists); if your thumb and middle finger do not touch, you are large jointed 
(usually 8 inches or more in wrist circumference). In general, women lean toward the smaller-jointed 
side. 
8. Digestive differences 

================================================================================
The structure and function of each person‘s digestive system varies dramatically. The width of the 
esophagus can vary at least fourfold and this can affect the amount of food swallowed. Human 
stomachs also vary in size: some can hold six to eight times as much as others. Secretion of digestive 
enzymes and gastric fluids can vary. Some people have more efficient digestion and absorb and utilize 
nutrients better. Hormones that affect how full or hungry you feel are also produced in the 
gastrointestinal tract, and hormonal response can differ from one person to the next. 
9. Food allergies and insensitivities 
Some people are born with the tendency toward food allergies or sensitivities. Two common examples 
are lactose intolerance (an inability to properly digest dairy products) and gluten intolerance (an 
allergy to the protein found in wheat and certain other grains). Through years of trial and error, most 
people instinctively favor certain foods while shying away from others. Some people become 
vegetarians, while others are carnivores, simply because of the way each food or diet makes them feel. 
Other people ignore their body‘s signals and suffer the consequences, from mild gastrointestinal 
disturbances to more serious health problems. 
10. Carbohydrate tolerance 
Some people‘s bodies don‘t handle carbohydrates very well. Carb-intolerant individuals often suffer 
from blood-sugar- and insulin-related metabolic disorders and may have problems with appetite 
regulation. Their condition gets worse if they eat large doses of sugar or other concentrated 
carbohydrates. This explains why one person can stay lean, healthy, and energetic on a meal plan high 
in rice, potatoes, whole grains, and other high-carb foods, while another gains fat and suffers from 
mood swings, low energy, and health problems eating the same thing. 
THE TRUTH ABOUT GENETICS AND YOUR POTENTIAL 
Judging by the list of traits that can‘t be changed, you might think the only surefire road to athletic 
success or a super-lean body is to choose the right parents. The great news is that fat loss and fitness 
are not determined by genetics alone. The way your body looks today is the result of genetics, 
behavior, and environment all put together. The truth is the factors you can‘t control are small potatoes 
compared to the ones you can. 
Dedication, discipline, and hard work can take you so far, it can appear as if you‘ve shattered your 
genetic ―limits.‖ The reality is that most people never come close to fulfilling their full potential. A 
belief in limitations stops many from even exploring it. How much potential do you have? You‘ll 
never know unless you get busy and find out. 
If you‘re below average on the genetic bell curve, you‘ll have to accept that getting lean or 
muscular might be more challenging or take longer for you than others. So ignore what the others are 
doing, especially the genetic freaks, because anything works for them. Instead, accept the challenge of 
lifelong personal improvement. Regardless of your genetics, you can transform yourself as long as you 
follow the right plan and customize it for your body type. 
HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR BODY TYPE: THE SOMATOTYPE 
SYSTEM 

================================================================================
In the 1930s and 1940s, American psychologist William Herbert Sheldon became engrossed in the 
study of human body types. Sheldon‘s main objective was to discover how variations in human 
physiques were related to personality types or temperaments. Part of his research included studying 
more than 4,000 photographs, from which he pioneered a system for identifying body types known as 
somatotyping. 
Sheldon‘s system said that you can discern a person‘s body type by visual inspection (the 
photoscopic method). You simply compare how you look to a list of body-type characteristics. The 
modern body-typing method we use goes beyond external structure alone, and considers body fat, lean 
mass, metabolic traits, behavioral tendencies, and a person‘s tendency toward weight and body 
composition change. 
There are three basic body types: 
• Endomorphs are the large, fatter types. They have a soft roundness and often have difficulty losing 
body fat. 
• Mesomorphs are mostly muscular types. They are lean, hard, and naturally athletic, and gain 
muscle with ease. 
• Ectomorphs are the lean, skinny types. They are thin and bony, with fast metabolisms and 
extremely low body fat. 
Pure body types are rare; a combination is more common. For example, someone who gains muscle 
easily but also has a tendency to gain fat along with the muscle is an endomorphic mesomorph (endo-
meso). This body type is typical of football linemen, heavyweight wrestlers, and powerlifters; they 
have lots of muscle, but it‘s often covered with a layer of fat. The ectomorphic mesomorph (ecto-
meso) is the person who is lean and linear, with moderate amounts of muscle. Basketball players are 
often ecto-meso body types (think Michael Jordan). 
Keep in mind that the somatotype system gives only general guidelines and the lines between body 
types are somewhat subjective. What‘s most important is knowing your predominant type and 
understanding how to use that knowledge in a practical way. 
To help classify yourself, the next step is to take a closer look at the body-type characteristics. 
We‘ll also go through a list of action strategies to help you customize your nutrition, training, and 
lifestyle plan to get the best results for your body type. 
ENDOMORPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND TENDENCIES 
Endomorphs are the naturally round, fatter types. Endomorphs have a tendency for weight gain and 
slower weight loss. They often struggle with cycles of weight loss and regain throughout their lives. 
Santa Claus is the archetypal endomorph. Endomorphs typically: 
• have naturally high levels of body fat (often overweight) 
• are usually big-boned, large jointed 
• have short, tapering arms and legs 
• have soft, round body contours (round or apple-shaped body) 
• have a wide waist and hips (waist dominates over chest) 
• describe themselves as having a ―slow metabolism‖ 
• have a moderate or poor carb tolerance 

================================================================================
• respond better to higher protein and low or moderate carbs 
• tend to partition excess calories into fat (can‘t get away with overeating) 
• have difficulty losing weight (it requires more effort) 
• tend to gain fat easily when exercise is stopped 
• tend to lose fat slowly, even on a reduced-calorie diet 
• respond best to longer, more frequent cardio sessions 
• find it challenging to keep fat off after it is lost 
• fall asleep easily and sleep deeply 
• tend to be sluggish and tired, and lack energy 
• have low activity and NEAT levels 
Endomorphic Training, Nutrition, and Lifestyle Strategies 
When it comes to fat loss, a well-planned, strategic approach is more important for the endomorph 
than any other body type. Their bodies are very unforgiving, so they require stricter compliance to 
their meal plans and more careful tracking of daily calorie and macronutrient goals. Many 
endomorphs respond well to reducing carbs. The endomorph strategy calls for high levels of activity, 
including an active lifestyle, weight training, and cardio. Endomorphs must be disciplined and 
consistent in everything they do. 
REDUCE CARBOHYDRATES 
Endomorphs often have varying degrees of carb intolerance, so high-carb, low-fat diets are usually not 
ideal. The endomorph nutrition strategy leans toward more protein, healthy fats, and fibrous carbs, 
with natural starches and whole grains eaten in moderation. Carbs may be included successfully if 
they are cycled and used strategically around training times. You‘ll learn more about nutrient timing 
and carb cycling strategies in upcoming chapters. 
KEEP CHEAT MEALS TO A MINIMUM 
Everyone can include their favorite indulgence foods in their meal plans if they do it sensibly. 
However, endomorphs have unforgiving bodies, so they have to do it more cautiously. They cannot 
eat whatever they want whenever they want or indulge in free-for-all cheat days and expect to get 
away with it. Plan cheat meals in advance, and make sure they fit into your daily calorie and 
macronutrient limits. Most endomorphs do best with a fairly strict 90 percent compliance rule. That 
means limiting junk foods to 10 percent or less of weekly calories, or allowing no more than two cheat 
meals per week. 
INCREASE CARDIO DURATION OR INTENSITY 
A simple way to burn more fat is with longer or harder cardio workouts. Twenty to thirty minutes is a 
good starting point, but to maximize fat loss, most endomorphs get better results building up to 40 to 
45 minutes. In some cases, up to 60 minutes per day may be ideal. This could also be split into more 
than one session. Once you‘ve reached your goal, you can return to shorter workouts for maintenance. 
For time efficiency, a great strategy is to increase the intensity of the cardio you‘re already doing and 
burn more calories in the same amount of time. Either way, endomorphs should focus on burning 
more. 

================================================================================
INCREASE TRAINING FREQUENCY 
Endomorphs must stay in motion to keep their metabolism revved up. Think of your metabolic rate as 
a spinning top. You twist the top and it starts spinning at maximum velocity, but soon after you let go, 
the top is already slowing down. Eventually it starts to wobble. You have to spin it again before it 
loses its momentum and topples over. By spinning it more frequently, the average rpm‘s stay higher 
and the top never slows to a wobble. 
Every bout of intense training ―spins‖ your metabolic rate, but this exercise-induced boost doesn‘t 
last long. Building more muscle with weight training can create a long-term increase in metabolism, 
but the only way to keep your metabolism ―spinning‖ is with frequent and consistent exercise. Cardio 
and resistance training combined give you the best results. 
USE METABOLISM-STIMULATING RESISTANCE EXERCISES 
Resistance training is essential. By choosing large muscle full-body and lower-body exercises, you not 
only build lean mass and strength, you also increase metabolism, burn more calories, and stimulate 
hormones that improve body composition. Squats, dead lifts, lunges, pull-ups, rows, presses, and other 
compound exercises are your best choices. Exercises like yoga, Pilates, and tai chi have some great 
benefits, including flexibility and stress reduction, but for the endomorph they‘re not the ideal way to 
maximize fat loss. If you enjoy these activities, do them to supplement—not replace—your weight 
training. 
ADOPT A MORE ACTIVE LIFESTYLE 
The natural endomorph‘s disposition is to take it easy and relax. Endomorphs like to kick back in an 
easy chair for the weekend, while their ectomorphic or mesomorphic counterparts might ―relax‖ with 
a 100-mile bike ride or a hike through the mountains. The best strategy for the endomorph is to get 
some kind of activity daily. Get out of your chair at regular intervals throughout the day. Walk 
everywhere. Take up some sports or recreational activities in addition to your regular workouts in the 
gym. 
AVOID OVERSLEEPING 
Sleep is important for recovery and overall health, but endomorphs should become early risers and 
avoid excessive sleeping. Endomorphs often have the urge to hit the snooze button. Resisting this 
habit and getting up early to review your goals and train is one of the best strategies to get a positive 
start on the day. 
WATCH LESS TV 
Any pastimes or hobbies that glue your rear end to a couch or easy chair are not ideal for an 
endomorph, especially if you spend 40 hours or more behind a desk each week. Replace as much TV 
time as possible with physical recreation or exercise—unless your workout machine is parked in front 
of the TV and you‘re on it. 
ALWAYS BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOMETHING TO MOTIVATE AND INSPIRE YOU 
Endomorphs sometimes lack motivation, especially if results are slow. The solution is to be on 
constant lookout for anything to inspire you. Read biographies, watch sports or the Olympics, get a 
training partner, read motivational books, listen to inspiring audio programs, hire a trainer, get a 
coach, rewrite your goals every day, go watch a bodybuilding or fitness contest, or even enter a body 
transformation contest yourself. Do whatever it takes to stay mentally pumped! 

================================================================================
BE CONSISTENT 
Except for occasional planned layoffs and vacations, the endomorph can‘t relax his efforts or it will 
take a long time to achieve big goals. Endomorphs must be very consistent and disciplined in eating 
and training habits 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. Spurts of starting and stopping never work for the 
endomorph. Get your momentum going and keep it going. 
BE PATIENT 
Endomorphs often lose fat more slowly than the other body types. However, endomorphs can reach 
their body composition goals just like everyone else. It simply may take a little longer. Patience is a 
virtue that all endomorphs must cultivate. 
MAKE A LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO EXERCISE 
Exercise is one of the most important factors in successful weight-loss maintenance and it‘s more 
important for the endomorph than anyone else. The endomorph tendency is to gain fat when sedentary 
and regain fat when exercise is stopped. Every time you stop working out for an extended period, 
body fat will start to creep back on. Burning fat is one thing. Keeping it off is another. It takes a 
lifetime commitment to stay lean. 
ECTOMORPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND TENDENCIES 
Ectomorphs are naturally lean, skinny types. Ectomorphs have a tendency to lose weight easily and 
have a hard time gaining muscle. They rarely have trouble with excess body fat during their entire 
lives. The 1960s model Twiggy was the quintessential ectomorph. Ectomorphs typically: 
• have long limbs and are linear 
• have small joints and are small-boned 
• have a small waist and narrow shoulders 
• have angular, projecting bones 
• are naturally lean; lose fat very easily 
• often call themselves ―hard gainers‖ 
• have low strength levels prior to starting a training program 
• have a fast metabolism and burn up everything they eat 
• have good carbohydrate tolerance 
• have a high energy level 
• tend to be overactive and restless 
• sometimes suffer from insomnia 
• have high levels of NEAT 
• sometimes find it hard to maintain weight 
• find it extremely hard to gain weight 
• respond best to low-volume, brief, infrequent, heavy weight training 
Ectomorphic Training, Nutrition, and Lifestyle Strategies 

================================================================================
The common complaint of the ectomorph is: ―I‘ve always been too skinny. No matter what I eat, I can 
never gain weight.‖ Many ectomorphs start weight training to fill out their bony frames. Although 
ectomorphs rarely develop the muscle size of mesomorphs, with hard work and persistence, most of 
them can build impressive physiques with the advantage of staying lean without much effort. 
However, if they quit training or allow their calories to drop too low for too long, they‘ll eventually 
slide back toward the level of thinness to which their bodies are naturally inclined. 
Most Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle readers are not pure ectomorphs, because this is a fat-loss-
focused book and ectomorphs are naturally lean. There are some exceptions, such as the combination 
ecto-endo body type with skinny legs, skinny arms, and a large belly. An ectomorph can successfully 
use many of Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle‘s strategies, but the average ecto is more likely to use 
them for muscle gain than fat loss. Eating more and doing less cardio is the common prescription. 
The following guidelines will help maximize results for the ectomorphic body type. 
SLOW DOWN AND REDUCE STRESS 
Because ectomorphs are thin, hyperactive people with fast metabolisms, the first and most obvious 
solution is less activity. Like an engine idling too fast, an ectomorph has to keep a foot on the brake 
just to keep from lurching forward. Conserving nervous energy is important. Ectomorphs need to get 
plenty of quality sleep on a regular schedule. Stress reduction techniques can help the ectomorph get 
better results as well. 
FOCUS ON WEIGHT TRAINING BUT AVOID OVERTRAINING 
Ectomorphs respond best to brief, heavy, basic weight training programs. Daily training and high-
volume workouts might even be counterproductive. The ectomorph should get in and out of the gym 
quickly and allow plenty of recuperation between workouts. 
KEEP CARDIO TO A MINIMUM 
The big challenge for the ectomorph is gaining or even maintaining lean body weight. That‘s why 
cardio should be kept to a minimum and be done mainly for health and conditioning reasons. Twenty 
to thirty minutes a day, three days a week, is usually enough. Extreme ectomorphs might want to 
avoid cardio completely; the weight training alone will provide cardiovascular and health benefits. 
KEEP THE CALORIES HIGH AND NEVER MISS MEALS 
Ectomorphs need calories—lots of them. To gain muscle, they have to hit their protein goal every day 
and achieve a calorie surplus. Foods with high calorie density, including moderate amounts of healthy 
fats, are useful. Skipping meals is a cardinal sin for the ectomorph. 
EAT CARBS 
Since ectomorphs are already lean and burn up nearly everything they eat, there‘s rarely a reason to 
restrict carbs, outside of blood-sugar-related health problems. Removing carbs only makes it harder to 
get enough calories for a surplus. Fifty percent of total calories from carbs is a standard baseline for 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle (not carb restricted), and that works well for an ecto. 
PAY ATTENTION TO FOOD QUALITY 
People with ectomorphic tendencies usually discover they can get away with eating junk food without 
ill effects on body composition, so they often do. However, this is not wise, because even an 
ectomorph should be concerned about nutrient density and food quality, not just food quantity. Choose 

================================================================================
foods for health, not just for fuel and muscle growth. Never use a naturally lean body type as an 
excuse to overindulge in junk food. 
MESOMORPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND TENDENCIES 
Mesomorphs (a.k.a. the ―genetic freaks‖) are the naturally muscular and lean types. Many of them had 
muscle before they started working out. These are the genetically gifted ones who everyone loves to 
hate because they gain muscle and lose fat so easily. Heavyweight competitive bodybuilders are the 
prime example of the mesomorphic body type (think Arnold Schwarzenegger in his Mr. Olympia 
prime). Miss Olympia figure and fitness champions such as Erin Stern and Monica Brant represent the 
mesomorphic body on the female side. Mesomorphs typically: 
• have medium joint size 
• have broad shoulders 
• have a larger chest and smaller waist 
• are naturally lean 
• are naturally muscular 
• are naturally strong 
• have high energy levels 
• have great carbohydrate tolerance 
• tend to partition surplus calories into muscle 
• have a highly efficient (fast) metabolism 
• gain strength easily 
• gain muscle easily 
• lose body fat easily 
• respond quickly to almost any type of training 
• are natural-born strength and power athletes 
Mesomorphic Training, Nutrition, and Lifestyle Strategies 
There‘s not much to say about mesomorphic training and nutrition. The ironic thing about 
mesomorphs is that for many of them it doesn‘t matter what they eat or how they train; they lose body 
fat and gain muscle anyway. As long as they have the basic nutrition and training fundamentals 
covered, they get results. 
Here are two tips for the mesomorph to live by: 
DON’T COAST ON YOUR GENETICS 
Although they‘re envied by many, mesomorphs do have their Achilles‘ heel. Because they get results 
so easily, they often coast on their genetics and don‘t train as hard as they could. They may cheat on 
their diets and skip workouts simply because they can get away with it and still look good. As a result, 
many never actualize their full potential. 
A mesomorph with clear goals and a superior work ethic will always rise to the top and quickly 
become a superstar. These are the people who can become pro bodybuilders, fitness models, or 

================================================================================
Olympic athletes. If you recognize that you‘re genetically gifted for physique development, appreciate 
your blessing and make the most of it, even if you‘re not interested in sports or competition. 
PAY ATTENTION TO FOOD QUALITY 
Like the ectomorphs, people with mesomorphic tendencies discover that they can also get away with 
eating certain foods without ill effects on body composition, so they get lax about their food choices 
and lower their compliance rule too far. Again, keep in mind that nutrition is not just about looking 
good; it‘s about being healthy. Gorging on junk food just because you can get away with it in the short 
term is not a good idea. In the best-case scenario, it will limit your development. In the worst-case 
scenario, it could compromise your health. 
BODY TYPE VERSUS METABOLIC TYPE 
In the classic system, ―somatotype‖ refers to the physical or external body structure, which you can 
appraise with a photograph or tape measure. ―Metabolic type‖ is different; it refers to biological 
processes that take place internally. Another new advancement in body typing is combining these 
concepts of somatotype and metabolic type. For example, endomorphs are the people who have the 
rounder body shape as well as metabolic characteristics that predispose them to storing and holding 
excess body fat. 
How well you process carbs and manage blood sugar is one of the most important traits to consider. 
People differ widely in their ability to process sugar. On the extremely unhealthy end of the spectrum, 
you have diabetes. In the middle, you have metabolic syndrome, which some people call ―pre-
diabetic.‖ And on the normal end of the spectrum you have various degrees of carbohydrate 
intolerance. 
These differences in metabolic type explain why some people thrive on high-carb, low-protein, low-
fat diets while others get leaner, feel better, and stay healthier on high-protein, high-fat diets with 
lower carbs. 
Although metabolic traits are numerous and complex, in the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle system, 
metabolic type boils down to two simple questions: Are you carb tolerant or carb intolerant? And if 
you‘re carb intolerant, to what degree? Use the body type guidelines in this chapter, along with the 
information in the nutrition part of this book, and with a little trial and error experimenting with carb 
levels, you‘ll discover your tolerance quickly. 
SIZING UP YOUR TRUE NATURAL BODY TYPE 
Somatotyping has fascinated bodybuilders, athletes, and fitness fanatics for decades. The classic 
Sheldon system did, however, have a major flaw: It was a genotypic system, which assumes that your 
body type is genetically fixed and can‘t be changed. That‘s only partly true. Obviously some 
characteristics like joint size and height are unchangeable after we‘re adults, but it‘s also obvious that 
our bodies do transform as a result of training, nutrition, and lifestyle change. That‘s the whole idea, 
isn‘t it? The ultimate goal is to start looking like a soft, round endomorph and finish looking like a 
lean, muscular mesomorph. 
Modern body-typing science is based on a phenotypic system, which assumes that the way your 
body looks is a result of behavior and environment, not just genetics. Your body changes on its own 
with growth and aging, and you change your body purposely with nutrition, training, and lifestyle 
choices. 

================================================================================
That‘s why the way a person looks now after training may not be a reliable indicator of their true 
natural body type. How they looked before they started training is more revealing. There‘s an inside 
joke among bodybuilders who look great despite having less than ideal genes: ―The harder I work, the 
better my genetics appear.‖ 
Another true sign of your natural body type is what happens when you stop training. Do you retain 
your muscle gains (mesomorphic) or do you atrophy quickly (ectomorphic)? Does the body fat stay 
off (ectomorphic or mesomorphic) or do you regain fat quickly the minute you stop training 
(endomorphic)? Recognizing these tendencies will help you maximize and customize the Burn the 
Fat, Feed the Muscle program once you get started. 
The ultimate tale of the tape is how well you respond to training and nutrition. If you grow muscle 
like crazy and the fat melts off with ease as soon as you start any nutrition or training program, you 
have genetic gifts: You have the mesomorph‘s muscle-building qualities and the ectomorph‘s fat-
burning qualities. 
Body type doesn‘t dictate what your destiny is, but it does tell you what your tendency is and 
understanding your tendencies is valuable. We all have a natural body type we‘re born with. If we 
don‘t make a conscious effort to change the factors we control—behavior and environment—we‘ll 
always drift back to our inherent body types. 
CUSTOMIZING YOUR PLAN FOR YOUR BODY TYPE 
By now you should have a fairly good idea of your body type, and if you‘re still not sure, don‘t worry: 
You don‘t have to get it all at once. Now that you know what to look for, it will get easier to know 
yourself with every passing week you follow the program and pay attention to the results. Even more 
important than pinpointing your exact type is to simply understand that you‘re unique and your 
program must be fitted for your body. 
If you wore the wrong suit size, it wouldn‘t feel right. In the same way, when you follow the wrong 
nutrition and training plan, it just doesn‘t feel right. That‘s why it‘s best to avoid programs that aren‘t 
flexible. In the diet and fitness world, most people believe that there‘s only one single best way. But a 
one-size-fits-all approach couldn‘t possibly work for everyone. 
Customization can be the difference between great results and no results, and this theme runs 
through every chapter of this book. With your new knowledge of body types, combined with the tools 
you‘ll learn in the rest of this book, customizing your plan will be easy. You‘ll be able to personalize 
your goals, calories, protein, carbs, fats, macronutrient ratios, foods, fluid intake, meal schedules, 
training schedules, and everything else so it fits you perfectly. And when you‘ve got it, you‘ll know it, 
because it will feel right, just like a custom-tailored suit. 
ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY 
Many people read about genetics or body types and get concerned about whether they‘ve inherited 
―fat genes.‖ There‘s no doubt that heredity dictates your ultimate potential for muscular development 
and plays a role in how easily you burn fat. But the primary cause of excess body fat is your own 
attitude, behavior, and lifestyle. Science confirms that overweight people are more likely to be made 
than born and that following a healthy lifestyle can counteract gene-related risks. 
Most of the factors affecting body composition are entirely under your control. No matter what your 
body type or genetic potential, you can always improve by consistently taking action in all these areas. 

================================================================================
THE FACTORS YOU CONTROL 
• How much you eat 
• What you eat 
• When you eat 
• What type of exercise you do 
• How frequently you exercise 
• How long you exercise 
• How hard you exercise 
• Your overall lifestyle 
• Who you socialize with and allow to influence you 
• Your mental attitude 
The truth is, if you‘re unhealthy, you‘re unfit, or you have too much body fat, you‘re responsible. If 
you refuse to accept this, you‘ll never reach your full potential. If you want to burn fat and transform 
your body for good, the first step is to accept 100 percent responsibility for where you are now. 
When you‘re not getting the results you want, the easiest thing to do is to put the blame somewhere 
else and make excuses like ―It‘s my genetics‖ or ―I have a slow metabolism.‖ But if you don‘t believe 
you‘re in control and responsible for your life, for better or worse, how do you expect to change it? 
In a brief but powerful book called As a Man Thinketh, author James Allen wrote, ―Circumstances 
do not make a man, they reveal him.‖ We are not products of our environment or our heredity (our 
circumstances); we are products of our own thinking and belief systems. 
You create positive circumstances through positive thinking and positive action, and you create 
negative circumstances through negative thinking, lack of action, and wrong actions. In other words, 
you are responsible for who you are, where you are, and what you have—and that includes the way 
your body looks. 
DOING YOUR BEST WITH WHAT YOU’VE GOT 
Understanding your body type doesn‘t mean throwing in the towel if you‘re an extreme endomorph. It 
doesn‘t mean ―I‘m genetically inferior, so I won‘t even bother trying.‖ Be realistic about your body 
type and accept the role it plays in changing your body. Don‘t get discouraged if you don‘t have 
Olympian genetics. You can overcome nearly any obstacle if you‘re willing to work hard enough. I‘ll 
show you how, no matter what your genetic endowment, you can totally transform yourself with hard 
work, dedication, persistence, and a positive attitude. 
The late UCLA Bruins basketball coach John Wooden said, ―The good Lord in his infinite wisdom, 
did not create us all equal when it comes to size, strength, appearance, or various aptitudes. But 
success is not being better than someone else, success is the peace of mind that is a direct result of 
self-satisfaction in knowing that you gave your best effort to become the best of which you are 
capable.‖ 
Don‘t try to become better than someone else; become better than you used to be. Instead of 
focusing on comparisons, focus on progress and self-improvement. Do the absolute best you can with 
what you‘ve got and you‘ll be able to look in the mirror every day with the pride and self-esteem of a 
true winner.

PART 2 
THE L.E.A.N. PLAN OF ACTION 
ESTABLISH YOUR BASELINE 
CHAPTER 4 
Measuring Body Composition 
Losing weight is the wrong goal. You should forget about your weight and instead concentrate on 
shedding fat and gaining muscle! 
—Dr. William Evans, author of Biomarkers: The 10 Keys to Prolonging Vitality 
BODY COMPOSITION: MUSCLE WEIGHT VERSUS FAT WEIGHT 
Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but let‘s face it: Muscle looks better than fat. Fat fills in all 
the lines and ―cuts‖ that separate each distinct muscle group. It covers your muscles with a thick layer 
of insulation, obscuring the definition underneath, and adds a soft and doughy quality to your entire 
body. 
Muscle is what makes your body look solid, chiseled, and athletic, but muscle has more than 
aesthetic value. Your goal should be to develop and maintain muscle not only for how it looks but for 
what it will do for your metabolism, your strength, and your health. Unfortunately, most people pay 
little attention to how much muscle they have, because they‘re obsessed with scale weight. Big 
mistake! 
The scale doesn‘t tell you how much weight is fat and how much is muscle. Most dieters assume 
that weight loss is always a positive outcome, and weight gain negative. But what if the loss or gain 
came from muscle? Another problem is that your scale weight can fluctuate on a daily basis depending 
on your body‘s water level, leading you to misinterpret your results. 
Losing weight is easy. Losing fat and keeping it off—without losing muscle—is a bigger challenge. 
If you simply wanted to weigh less, I could show you how to drop 10 to 15 pounds over the weekend 
with natural diuretics and other dehydration tricks. Boxers and wrestlers do it all the time to make a 
weight class. But what good is it to lose water weight that you‘ll gain back as quickly as you lost it? 
If you want to get off the diet roller coaster and achieve permanent fat loss, the first thing you must 
lose is the preoccupation with scale weight. Instead, start judging your progress with lean body mass 
and body fat. Prioritizing body composition over body weight may be difficult at first, but it‘s essential 
to your long-term success. 
 

================================================================================
WHY IDEAL WEIGHT CHARTS ARE MISLEADING 
One of the oldest methods for finding your ideal or healthy weight is the height and weight chart, 
which recommends what you should weigh based on your height alone. These charts are still popular 
today. They‘re used by insurance companies, physicians, sports teams, and the military, but they‘re 
very misleading because they don‘t consider body composition. 
According to a height-weight chart, a 5-foot-8-inch male bodybuilder weighing 200 pounds would 
be misclassified as ―overweight‖ even though he has single-digit body fat, six-pack abs, and perfect 
health. On the other hand, a 115-pound woman can have 33 percent body fat and a 172-pound man 
can have 27 percent body fat. Both have acceptable body weights according to the charts, but if you 
take body composition into account, you realize they‘re overfat and unhealthy. 
These people with low body weight but high body fat are often called ―skinny fat.‖ That term may 
be fitness slang, but it‘s a real clinical condition: Researchers call it ―normal weight obesity.‖ Today 
there‘s a new epidemic called ―sarcopenic obesity.‖ This is where men and women are clinically obese 
and overweight, but their muscle mass is so low, they‘re weak and nonfunctional. They‘re also more 
prone to degenerative diseases like osteoarthritis, more susceptible to metabolic disorders, and more 
likely to die young. 
Sarcopenia by itself is a serious problem; it‘s the loss of muscle that happens as you age if you do 
nothing to prevent it. Sarcopenia has been in the news for years because health care professionals are 
so concerned about how it‘s destroying quality of life in older men and women. 
This should be a real wake-up call for people who think that strength and muscle aren‘t important 
for your health. These examples show us how losing weight and losing fat are not the same, being 
overweight and overfat are not the same, and there‘s a drastic difference between ideal weight and 
ideal body composition. That‘s why height and weight charts can‘t possibly tell you what your real 
ideal and healthy weight should be. 
FAILINGS OF THE BODY MASS INDEX 
Body mass index (BMI) is another method often used to diagnose someone as overweight or obese. 
BMI is calculated with a simple formula: weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. 
You get classified as overweight if your BMI is over 25 and obese if your BMI is over 30. 
Advocates of BMI say that it correlates with body composition and is a better gauge of health than 
your weight alone. The truth is, BMI might be an acceptable screening tool for the general population, 
but for many people BMI is just as misleading as height-weight charts. 
A ―skinny fat person‖ could have a ―healthy‖ BMI of 19 to 22 with a dangerously high level of 
body fat. A typical bodybuilder or strength athlete could have a ―dangerously high‖ BMI of 30 and a 
healthy, low level of body fat. According to the BMI, almost every player in the National Football 
League is overweight and some contestants in the Mr. Olympia competition are ―morbidly obese,‖ 
with BMIs of 40, even though there‘s not an ounce of visible fat on their bodies. 
Here‘s a personal example: As a natural bodybuilder, I weighed 201 pounds at my heaviest, and I‘m 
5 feet 8 inches tall. Let‘s plug my stats into the BMI formula and see what we come up with… 
201 pounds = 91.17 kilograms 
1.72 meters squared = 2.96 
91.17 ÷ 2.96 = 30.80 BMI 

================================================================================
Judging me according to my BMI of 30.80, my health is at risk and I need to lose some lard. 
Obviously, that‘s not the case, since I rarely hit double-digit body fat. 
Shape Up America!, the antiobesity campaign started by Dr. C. Everett Koop, published a statement 
years ago saying that BMI misclassifies one out of four people and should not be used by athletes who 
carry more muscle than most people. 
Even if you‘re a regular fitness enthusiast who doesn‘t compete in strength or physique sports, 
you‘re going to be eating and training like an athlete on the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle program. 
So forget about BMI and height-weight charts; the ideal way to rate your weight, check your health, 
and track your progress is body fat testing. 
BODY FAT TESTING: THE IDEAL WAY TO MEASURE YOUR 
PROGRESS 
Weigh yourself, but don‘t stop there. When you measure your body fat percentage as well, you‘ll be 
able to answer two important questions about body composition: 
1.  How much of your weight is body fat? 
2.  How much of your weight is lean body mass? 
Another reason you‘ll be measuring your body fat every week is so you can monitor your progress 
and get continual feedback about the effect your nutrition and training are having on your body. 
You‘ll be keeping track of what really counts—fat burned and muscle gained—not scale weight, BMI, 
someone else‘s ideal, or how much you worked out. 
Many people spend hours working out each week, but they‘re not getting results. The real problem 
is they don‘t even know it! They mistake activity for achievement. You could be spinning your wheels 
(burning up calories but putting them all back) or heading in the wrong direction (losing weight but 
not fat). In The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Steven R. Covey points out, ―Many people are 
climbing the ladder of success every day, only to find that it‘s leaning against the wrong wall.‖ 
Measuring your body fat is the only way to be sure all that activity is moving you in the right 
direction—toward better body composition, not just weight loss. 
WHAT IS AN AVERAGE LEVEL OF BODY FAT? 
Average body fat levels vary among the sexes and among different age groups. The average woman 
has about 23 percent body fat and the average man approximately 17 percent. Female hormones and 
child-bearing genetics cause women to carry at least 5 percent more body fat than men. In both 
genders, body fat usually increases with age, while lean body mass decreases. 
According to Dr. William Evans, who headed the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research 
Center on Aging at Tufts University, the average person loses 6.6 pounds of lean body mass every 
decade after age 20. The rate of lean tissue loss increases after age 45. With advancing age, most 
people gain fat even when body weight doesn‘t change much; the muscle shrinks as the fat 
accumulates. The average male college student (age 20) has about 15 percent body fat. The average 
sedentary middle-aged male has 25 percent body fat or more. 
WHAT IS AN IDEAL LEVEL OF BODY FAT? 

================================================================================
Keep in mind that the body fat levels I just mentioned are averages, not necessarily ideals. Basketball 
coaching legend John Wooden once said, ―Being average means you‘re as close to the bottom as you 
are to the top.‖ You can‘t achieve excellence if you‘re aiming for average. If you really think about it, 
when two-thirds of the population is overweight or obese, average isn‘t so good. Our standards have 
fallen. 
A body fat level of 25 percent statistically places a young woman in the average category, but 25 
percent isn‘t necessarily ideal; it‘s more like a passing grade. An optimal body fat percentage is 
around 16 percent to 20 percent for women and 10 percent to 14 percent for men. These ideal body fat 
goals will take work, but they are achievable and maintainable by almost anyone. Ideal body fat for 
athletes may be even lower, depending on the sport. 
Everyone carries body fat differently, but at optimal levels, you‘ll look lean and, for the most part, 
fat-free. If you want the look of a Men’s Fitness model or a figure competitor, you may need to drop 
your body fat even lower. Most men will start to see more muscle definition, including abs, when they 
hit the single digits. Women show nicely defined muscles when they reach the teens. 
You‘re not destined to get fatter as you get older, but in the general (non-athlete) population, the 
average older person has more body fat. To account for this, I included ranges in my rating scale 
instead of single numbers. Younger people can use the low end of the range and older people can use 
the higher number for setting goals.

Low numbers are nice for bragging rights, but what counts is whether you‘re healthy and happy 
with how you look. You can use my charts to help you set some initial goals, but overall, I recommend 
using body fat percentage as a way to track your progress over time. Focus on improving yourself 
instead of chasing after some Holy Grail number. 

================================================================================
HOW LOW SHOULD YOU GO? 
Competitive bodybuilders and endurance athletes such as marathon runners have been known to reach 
body fat levels as low as 3 percent to 4 percent in men and 9 percent to 10 percent in women. With 
today‘s obsession for leanness and the problem of body image disorders, the safety of dropping to 
very low body fat levels has rightfully been questioned. Being extremely lean is healthier than being 
obese, but trying to maintain extremely low body fat levels for too long might not be healthy or 
realistic, especially for women. 
Many women who try to maintain their body fat levels at or below 10 percent to 13 percent 
experience health problems. Their menstrual cycles and reproductive systems become disrupted and 
bone density may decrease, putting them at higher risk of osteoporosis as they grow older. 
For some athletes, reaching extremes of low body fat during a competitive season is simply part of 
the sport. Using extreme diets to get there or trying to maintain extreme low body fat is when most of 
the problems occur. Training and dieting in cycles so body fat levels vary between lean and 
competition lean is healthier and more sensible. The typical female figure or fitness competitor 
maintains a very lean and healthier body fat level 14 percent to 17 percent for most of the year, then 
drops down lower for competition. Men may drop as low as 3 percent to 5 percent for competitions, 
and then maintain their body fat levels at 8 percent to 10 percent in the off-season. 
You may have heard the term ―zero body fat‖ thrown around. It‘s impossible for body fat to drop to 
zero because some fat is stored internally and is necessary for normal body functioning. This 
―essential fat‖ reserve is necessary for energy storage, protection of internal organs, and insulation 
against heat loss. Essential fat is found in the nerves, brain, bone marrow, liver, lungs, heart, and 
nearly all the other glands and organs of the body. In women, this fat also includes sex-related fat 
deposits in breast tissue and the uterus. Essential body fat is at least 10 percent for women and 3 
percent for men. 
THE MOST POPULAR METHODS OF MEASURING BODY 
COMPOSITION 
The scale, tape measure, and mirror are all helpful, but alone they‘re not enough. Why not go strictly 
by the mirror? After all, if you‘re happy with how you look, that‘s what really counts, isn‘t it? The 
problem is, when you look at yourself in the mirror every day, it‘s difficult to see daily and weekly 
changes because they‘re taking place so slowly; it‘s like watching the grass grow. It‘s also difficult for 
most people to judge their progress objectively. You rarely see changes in your own body as easily as 
others do. That‘s why you need an objective, accurate, and scientific method for measuring your body 
composition. 
There are many ways to test your body fat, and in the next section I‘ll show you some of your 
options. Some are simple, inexpensive tests you can do by yourself or with a partner at home; others 
use high-tech equipment or require a professional to help you. Experts debate about which method is 
best. After weighing the pros and cons, I think you‘ll agree that for our purpose—tracking weekly 
personal progress—skinfold testing is the easiest and most practical. 
Skinfold Measurements: The ―Pinch an Inch‖ Test 

================================================================================
When you‘re choosing a method for body fat testing, you need something that‘s practical, 
inexpensive, and easy to perform, and provides consistency over repeated measurements. The skinfold 
test fits the bill perfectly. Here‘s how it works: 
Most of your body fat is stored directly beneath your skin. This type of fat deposit is called 
subcutaneous fat. The remainder of your body‘s fat is located around organs (internal or visceral fat) 
and inside muscle tissue (intramuscular fat). Measuring the amount of subcutaneous fat you have by 
pinching folds of skin and fat at several locations can give you a very accurate estimate of your overall 
body fat percentage. 
It‘s ideal to have your body fat tested by a skilled technician, such as an exercise physiologist or 
experienced personal trainer at your gym. A friend, family member, or training partner can test you, 
but keep in mind there‘s a learning curve and the test is only as accurate as the skill of the person 
taking the measurements. Practice does make perfect, though. 
The test is done with a viselike instrument called a skinfold caliper. There are many brands of 
calipers. The Lange, Harpenden, and Skyndex are some of the most common and accurate 
professional models, although the cost can be high, ranging anywhere from $150 to as much as $450 
for the electronic Skyndex. If someone else will be testing you at home, I recommend the Slim Guide 
caliper because it‘s one of the few inexpensive (under $20) models that give fairly accurate readings. 
During a skinfold test, you literally get ―pinched‖ at several sites on your body. The jaws of the 
caliper clamp down on the fold of skin and fat and measure the thickness in millimeters (the larger the 
skinfold, the more fat you have). Then you add up the sum of the skinfolds and look up the results on 
the body fat estimation chart that comes with the caliper. The chart converts your skinfold thickness 
measurements into a body fat percentage. Computerized calipers like the Skyndex and Accu-Measure 
FatTrack models add up the skinfolds automatically and do the calculations for you. 
There are many different body fat formulas for skinfold testing. Most have you measure at three or 
four different locations. Some formulas use as many as eleven skinfolds in various combinations. The 
standard skinfold sites are usually the abdominal, suprailiac (hip), bicep, tricep, chest, subscapular 
(upper back), thigh, axilla (below the armpit), and calf. Taking measurements at three or four sites is 
most common and is more than enough for an accurate reading. 
Don‘t get too caught up with where your skinfolds are measured. Some people get concerned if 
most of their visible fat is in their lower bodies and the skinfold test measures only the upper-body 
sites. Body fat formulas from skinfolds will give you a very accurate estimate of your overall body fat 
using only one to four sites, even if they‘re all measured from your upper body. 
Skinfold Self-Testing: How to Measure Your Body Fat in the Privacy of Your Own Home 
The Accu-Measure is a skinfold caliper designed specifically for testing yourself at home. All you 
have to do is pinch one spot: your hip bone (the suprailiac skinfold). Since that site is easy to reach 
and measure, no partner is needed. A conversion chart comes with the caliper and you simply look up 
the skinfold thickness in millimeters to translate that into body fat percentage. 
The potential margin for error with self-testing might be greater when you do it by yourself, 
especially when you‘re a newbie, but research has validated this test. A study published in the Journal 
of Strength and Conditioning Research found the Accu-Measure to be just as accurate as the sum of 
three skinfolds taken by an experienced tester with a professional caliper. 
If you don‘t have access to other forms of testing, the Accu-Measure is definitely good news. Even 
if you‘re not sure about the accuracy of the body fat percentage number, the home self-test at least 
tells you whether your fat percentage is dropping. As long as you see the skinfold thickness dropping, 
it means you‘re losing fat! 

================================================================================
The big advantage of the Accu-Measure is the convenience: You can use it to test your own body 
fat at home. Another plus is the low cost. The Accu-Measure retails for less than $20 and it‘s readily 
available online at many Internet sites.

www.BurnTheFatFeedTheMuscle.com. 
Accuracy and Consistency of Skinfold Fat Testing 
When caliper measurements are taken correctly by an experienced tester, the results are very accurate 
for people in the range of 15 percent to 35 percent body fat. For individuals with over 35 percent body 
fat, the accuracy of the pinch test does go down somewhat. For lean individuals, skinfolds might be 
the most accurate method of all (using a multisite test is preferable for very lean people). 
Skinfold testing does require a lot of practice to master the pinching technique. The greatest errors 
result from not locating the right spot or from taking the skinfold improperly (for example, taking a 
horizontal fold when it should be a vertical fold). 
Because there are so many different types of calipers and skinfold formulas, the important thing is 
to have the same person measure you with the same caliper and the same formula every time. Even 
with the most skilled tester, skinfolds are only accurate within 3 to 4 percent. 
However, if a skinfold test says you are 12 percent body fat, it doesn‘t matter if your body fat is 
really 15 percent. The accuracy is not as important as the consistency of repeated measurements so 
that you can chart your progress effectively from one measurement to the next. You‘ll learn more 
about how to track and chart progress in the next chapter, but first, let‘s take a quick look at some of 
the other body fat testing methods. 
Other Methods of Body Fat Testing 
Skinfold measurement is by far the most popular way to test body fat, and it‘s my top recommendation 
for this program. However, there are many other methods. Some of them are high-tech and extremely 
accurate but not as practical. Some are even more practical than skinfolds but questionable in 
accuracy. I want you to know about all the options available, so here are the most popular of the 
alternative methods. 
Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis 
Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measures your body fat by testing the electrical conductivity 
of your body tissues. Lean body mass, because of its high (80 percent) water content, is highly 
conductive. Fat, because of its low (15 percent) water content, has an insulating effect and is less 
conductive. 
The traditional impedance test is done by attaching electrodes to the skin of your right wrist and 
right foot. Low-amperage current is then passed through your entire body to measure resistance 
against muscle, bones, and fat tissue. A reading of resistance in ohms is then given to determine body 
fat. 
BIA is a fairly reliable and valid measure of body composition, as long as the test procedures are 
followed properly. The results can fluctuate if you‘re dehydrated from alcohol, caffeine, exercise, or 
heavy sweating. 

================================================================================
BIA BODY FAT SCALES AND HAND GRIP TESTS 
The most popular body fat testing scales are manufactured by Tanita. The most popular hand grippers 
are produced by Omron. These scales and grippers use BIA technology, although they‘re not the same 
as the whole-body BIA test done with the electrodes on the hand and foot. New BIA scales have been 
developed that also have hand grippers. In theory, these hand-to-foot BIA devices should be more 
accurate, but there‘s not much evidence to verify that yet. 
The advantage of using a body fat testing scale is being able to test yourself at home; nothing beats 
them for convenience and ease of use. But what you gain in convenience, you might lose in accuracy. 
If you decide to use the body fat testing scales, be sure to follow the test protocol to the letter. That 
includes a consistent time of day for the weigh-in. I‘ve heard many reports from Burn the Fat readers 
and members saying that their morning test results fluctuated by as much as 5 percent from their 
nighttime results. 
If you think the scale is giving you consistent and repeatable measurements, then by all means 
continue to use it. However, don‘t be surprised if you see wild fluctuations and strange readings. 
Given the pros and cons, for home testing, I consider these scales only a second-best choice behind 
skinfold testing. 
Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Testing) 
Fat floats and muscle sinks. This simple fact is the basis for underwater weighing, also known as 
hydrostatic testing. Hydrostatic testing has always been the gold standard to which all other body fat 
testing methods are compared. However, being dunked under water is inconvenient, and you usually 
have to visit a hospital or university research center to get the test done. It can also be expensive, 
although at some universities you can volunteer to be a guinea pig for exercise science students doing 
research projects. All things considered, underwater weighing is not very practical, but it‘s always 
interesting to have it done once in a while just for fun. 
The Bod Pod (Air Displacement) 
The Bod Pod uses a technology called air displacement plethysmography. You sit in an egg-shaped 
fiberglass chamber and breathe into a tube, and the machine prints out your body composition results, 
including lean body mass and body fat. Several studies suggest that the Bod Pod has potential as 
another valid body fat testing tool, including in overweight and obese subjects. However, the Bod Pod 
has not been fully validated in all populations yet, so the jury is still out. If you‘re athletic, muscular, 
or already lean, the Bod Pod may slightly overestimate your body fat. Bod Pods can be found in many 
health clubs, sports medicine facilities, and some universities. The cost can vary: I‘ve seen it range 
from $25 to $75 per test. 
Circumference Testing 
You may have seen some of these formulas or calculators on the Internet: You simply take your 
measurements at one or more sites on your body, then plug them into the calculator with your height 
and weight, and it delivers an instant body fat estimate. The Navy formula is one of the most popular 
methods. 
A tape measure can‘t directly measure body fat, but there is a correlation between body 
circumferences, the relationship between those measurements, and your body fat percentage. These 

================================================================================
formulas are simple, convenient, and inexpensive, but there may be a larger degree of error compared 
to skinfold testing and hydrostatic weighing. I recommend circumference methods if you have no 
other testing options and you want a ballpark figure of your body fat. 
It‘s well worth remembering, however, that there‘s a strong correlation between your waist 
circumference and your total body fat. If there‘s any reason you don‘t measure your body fat 
percentage, the very least you should do is to track your weight and your waist measurement. If your 
waist measurement is going down, your body fat percentage is almost always going down as well. 
Your waist measurement is also an important health marker. Fat stored in the abdominal area is 
unhealthier than fat stored in the extremities. A large waist measurement is a symptom of metabolic 
syndrome, a precursor to diabetes, and it correlates to increased risk of heart disease and stroke. 
You‘re at risk if you‘re male and your waist measurement is over 40 inches or if you‘re female and 
your waist measurement is over 35 inches. 
QUICK START 
Not sure which body fat testing method to choose? My number one recommendation is to get an 
accurate skinfold test. Don’t have access to caliper tests or can’t get an accurate measurement? 
Measure your waist circumference with a tape measure and use it as a proxy for body fat 
percentage. Above all else, just remember, weight loss and fat loss are not the same thing. 
DEXA and Other Body Fat Testing Methods 
There are some other body fat testing methods that are high-tech, incredibly accurate, and very useful 
in the laboratory. Many experts consider the DEXA scan (which is also used to analyze bone density) 
the new gold standard. (―DEXA‖ stands for ―dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.‖) The problem is, due 
to inconvenience, inaccessibility, and expense, none of these methods is practical for personal home 
use and weekly results tracking. For example, a DEXA scan is usually available only at hospitals; it 
requires that you lie still for up to 20 minutes; and it can cost anywhere from $100 to $250 per test. 
HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR FAT WEIGHT AND LEAN BODY 
MASS 
By itself, your body fat percentage is nothing more than a number. The real value in knowing your 
body fat is to monitor your body composition progress from one week to the next. Once you know 
your body fat percentage, the next step is to calculate how much of your total weight is fat and how 
much is muscle. Then you can track your progress in total weight, fat weight, and lean body mass 
(LBM). 
Your LBM is the total weight of all your body tissues excluding fat. This includes not only muscle 
but also bone and other fat-free tissues. Since muscle is the largest component of lean body mass, 
tracking your LBM can tell you if you‘ve lost or gained muscle. Monitoring your LBM is one of the 
most useful and important purposes of body fat testing. 
To calculate your LBM in pounds, you need to know two things: your body weight and your body 
fat percentage. First, determine how many pounds of fat you‘re carrying by multiplying your body fat 
percentage by your weight. You can then calculate your lean mass by subtracting the pounds of fat 
from your total body weight. 

================================================================================
Example 
YOUR BODY WEIGHT IS 194 POUNDS. 
Your body fat percentage is 18 percent (0.18). 
Multiply your body fat by your weight to determine fat weight: 
0.18 × 194 pounds = 34.9 pounds fat 
Subtract fat weight from total weight to determine lean mass: 
194 pounds − 34.9 pounds fat = 159.1 pounds lean mass 
A SIMPLE TEST TO DETERMINE YOUR TRUE IDEAL WEIGHT 
Now that you understand the importance of body fat versus body weight and you‘ve seen the pitfalls 
of BMI and height/weight charts, how do you figure out your ideal weight? First of all, consider that 
maybe it doesn‘t matter what you weigh. If you were solid muscle without an ounce of visible fat on 
your body, and you loved the way you looked in the mirror, would you honestly care how much you 
weighed? 
That said, it‘s still wise to have a weight goal in pounds as well as a body fat percentage goal. To 
calculate your ideal body weight, you need to know your current weight, your body fat percentage, 
your lean mass, and your target (desired) body fat percentage. 
Enter your lean body mass (LBM) ______________________________ 
Choose your target body fat % (TBF) ______________________________ 
Subtract your TBF from 1 (1 – TBF) ______________________________ 
Divide your LBM by the difference ______________________________ 
= Your ideal weight ______________________________ 
• The ideal weight formula is: lean body mass (LBM) ÷ (1 − target body fat %). 
• TBF is expressed as a decimal (15% body fat = 0.15). 
• You can subtract up to 2%–3% more off the estimated ideal formula weight if you want to account 
for potential water-weight losses. 
THE NEXT STEP: TRACKING YOUR PROGRESS 
You now have a strong intellectual understanding of body composition and why it‘s so important. 
When it really sinks in on a practical level is after you start following the nutrition and training plan 
and start tracking your progress. 

================================================================================
You‘ll learn more about your body by measuring and tracking your body weight, body fat, and lean 
body mass for just a few weeks than you will by reading about it for years. As the old saying goes, ―A 
single accurate measurement is worth a thousand expert opinions.‖ Recording your results, getting 
into a performance feedback loop, and charting your progress are steps that guarantee you‘ll never 
fail. You‘ll start this process in the next chapter. 
CHAPTER 5 
Tracking Progress: The Feedback Loop 
System That Won’t Let You Fail 
Realize that there is no such thing as failure. Keep this in mind and you will achieve all that you 
conceive in your mind. 
—Dr. Wayne W. Dyer, You’ll See It When You Believe It: The Way to Your Personal 
Transformation 
LIFE’S DELAYS ARE NOT LIFE’S DENIALS 
It was a dark and cloudy Thursday in May as I boarded a 757 for a 4:45 p.m. flight from Newark to 
San Francisco. I took my seat and waited for takeoff as I anticipated a relaxing week in northern 
California. Four forty-five came and went, but the plane didn‘t budge. At 4:55, the captain‘s voice 
echoed through the cabin over the loudspeakers: ―There are level 4 and 5 thunderstorms just east of 
Newark and they‘re headed our way. These storm winds can reach tornado force, so we‘ll have to wait 
it out.‖ We sat there on the runway for nearly two hours as fierce winds and a torrential downpour 
pelted the plane. 
Finally, at around 6:30 p.m., the storm passed and the plane started taxiing toward the runway. 
Because all the planes in line were backed up, we slowly inched our way forward and had to wait our 
turn. At 7:00 p.m. we finally took off. With all the turbulence in the air, it was a bumpy ride on the 
way up. A few passengers panicked and some even looked a little sick. After about five minutes of 
being tossed around, the air calmed and plane leveled. 
But we weren‘t headed toward San Francisco for long. Within minutes the plane shifted slightly off 
course. The onboard computer noted the plane‘s errant trajectory, the pilot made a small adjustment, 
and once again we were back on course. This process repeated itself for the entire six hours of the 
flight. Of course, I couldn‘t notice this by looking out the window, but I knew it was happening just 
the same because I knew how feedback systems work. 
You see, an airplane never travels in a perfectly straight line. Even with the most sophisticated 
guidance systems, there‘s always a certain amount of drift. Using a variety of feedback such as radar, 
radio beacons, geographical landmarks, and aeronautical charts, the navigation equipment picks up the 
slight change in course. The pilot (or autopilot) then adjusts the plane‘s direction. 

================================================================================
HOW TO USE PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK TO TRACK YOUR 
PROGRESS AND GUARANTEE YOUR SUCCESS 
The process of burning fat is a lot like the takeoff and flight of an airplane. Some people take a long 
time to get off the ground. Instead of patiently waiting out the storm, they quit before reaching takeoff 
speed. Others get off the ground, but as soon as they hit any turbulence, they quit and ―land the plane.‖ 
Some people even manage to coast comfortably toward their destination, making substantial progress. 
But the minute they find themselves off course, they also join the quitters instead of simply adjusting 
their direction. 
All these people made the same fatal mistake of interpreting their results as failure. Because they 
believed they had failed, they gave up. Can you imagine if a pilot quit every time there was a delay, 
turbulence, or a slight deviation in the plane‘s course? No one would ever get anywhere! The key to 
your success starts with a mental re-frame: 
There is no such thing as failure—only feedback, only results. 
Price Pritchett, author of The Quantum Leap Strategy, emphasizes that what often looks like failure 
is actually a work in progress: ―Everything looks like a failure in the middle. You can‘t bake a cake 
without getting the kitchen messy. Halfway through surgery it looks like there‘s been a murder in the 
operating room.‖ 
If you measure your body fat after a week of work and there‘s no change, you haven‘t failed; 
you‘ve simply produced a result. As long as you have a goal and you‘re taking efficient daily action, 
then whatever result you produce is ―performance feedback.‖ It may not be the result you want, but 
it‘s still valuable feedback. You‘ve learned one way that doesn‘t work. 
If you want a different result, try a different approach. One definition of insanity is continuing to do 
the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result. Thomas Edison tried thousands 
of experiments to find a filament that would burn in the electric light bulb. When asked what it felt 
like to fail so many times, Edison said: ―If I find 10,000 ways something won‘t work, I haven‘t failed. 
I am not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward. Just because 
something doesn‘t do what you planned it to do doesn‘t mean it‘s useless.‖ 
On the program each week, you‘ll always get some kind of results. It‘s how you interpret your 
results that determine whether you‘ll reach your destination. Like the pilot and Thomas Edison, you 
need to gather feedback and change your course the instant you notice you‘re not heading in the right 
direction. You‘ll be like a trained pilot, course correcting your body with the tools you learn in the 
program. 
THE FAT-LOSS SUCCESS SYSTEM THAT NEVER FAILS 
I‘ve developed a seven-step formula guaranteed to help you reach your goals. Because of this system‘s 
self-correcting nature, you can only fail if you stop using the system. Think of it as your own personal 
―navigation system.‖ Here are the seven steps: 
1. Know your outcome. Decide exactly where you want to go. 
Knowing what you want is the first step toward success. But saying you want to lose weight is not 
enough. There‘s a science to setting and achieving goals, and it involves knowing what you want 

================================================================================
specifically, when you want to have it, and what it will look like when you do. In Chapter 6 you‘ll 
learn the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle formula for goal setting. The important thing to know now is 
that nothing else you read in this book will be much help unless you have a clearly specified target. 
You might try a technique here and a tactic there, but ultimately you‘ll end up floundering because 
you won‘t have the direction, purpose, or motivation that come from having written goals. 
2. Establish your starting point. 
Knowing where you want to go isn‘t enough; you also need to know where you are now so you can 
chart the proper course from starting point to destination. Once you‘ve committed your goals to 
writing, the next step is to take objective starting measurements, including body fat percentage, total 
body weight, fat weight, and lean weight, using what you learned in Chapter 4. Once you have these 
numbers, write them down in the first row of your Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle progress chart, 
which you can find in the appendix. (You can also download an interactive progress chart spreadsheet 
from www.BurnTheFatFeedTheMuscle.com.) 
3. Formulate a plan of action. 
The most efficient way to choose a plan of action is to model (copy) the physical and mental strategies 
used by those who have already achieved what you want to achieve. Modeling suggests that, instead 
of reinventing the wheel, you plug into a proven formula that already exists. You tap into the 
knowledge and experience of those who have gone before you and learn from their mistakes. Find 
successful role models, do what they did, and you‘ll get a similar result. Trial and error can be a long 
and painstaking process, and life is too short to do it the long way. Learn from the experts. 
Choose your role models wisely. If you want to lose fat permanently, it makes no sense to model 
the 95 percent of the population who lose weight only to gain it all back. Who should you follow? 
Model the people who have mastered the science of burning fat and maintaining muscle in a healthy 
way. No one fits that description better than natural bodybuilders and fitness athletes. 
Modeling does have limitations. There‘s no guarantee that anyone can become a world class 
bodybuilding or figure champion because not everyone has the same genetic potential. What modeling 
will do is help you reach the upper limits of your own genetic capabilities in the shortest time using a 
system that‘s already been proven to work. It lets you become the best you can be and do it as quickly 
as possible by bypassing unnecessary trial and error. 
You‘re unique, so you‘ll always have to do some experimenting, no matter how time-tested your 
plan is. However, the leanest people in the world all hold certain things in common. The fundamental 
principles apply to everyone; there are laws of fat loss just as there are laws of gravity and electricity. 
People who get lean and stay lean have mastered them and you can learn them as well. 
A master chef produces award-winning dishes over and over again by using the same recipe—a 
proven mixture of ingredients, which, when combined in the right sequence and amounts, produces a 
delicious dish every time. This program is your recipe for surefire fat loss. The techniques in this book 
give you a guaranteed plan already tested and proven effective by the leanest athletes in the world. If 
you use the same recipe, it will work for you too. 
4. Act on your plan consistently. 
You can have the biggest goals and the best plan in the world, but if you don‘t act on them, you won‘t 
achieve a thing. A goal without action is worthless. Faith without action is dead. An affirmation 
without action is delusion. The bottom line is that you must put the book down, get off your butt, and 
get in the gym! Work at it. Deserve it. Pay the price. Earn it. Nothing worth having ever comes 

================================================================================
without effort. It takes hard work and efficient action every single day. You must do something every 
day to move you closer to your goal. 
5. Develop the sensory acuity to know if what you are doing is working or not. If it’s working, 
keep doing it. 
After putting your plan into action, you need to develop the sensory acuity to know if your plan is 
working. ―Sensory acuity‖ is a neuro-linguistic programming term used to describe your ability to see, 
feel, and notice even the smallest changes in your body. In a nutshell, it means paying attention. As 
long as you‘re taking action and tracking the results, it‘s okay to make mistakes. Mistakes are how we 
learn. The only person who makes no mistakes is the person who plays it safe and never tries 
anything. 
The problem is some people have been making the same nutrition and training mistakes for ten 
years, and they still wonder why they aren‘t getting any results. You‘ve got to be smarter than that. If 
you don‘t pay attention, you might be taking action but repeating the same mistakes over and over 
again. As Emerson once said, ―A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.‖ 
If someone asks you, ―Is your program working?‖ and your answer is ―I don‘t know,‖ then you‘re 
not paying attention and you need to develop better sensory acuity. Your program is either working or 
it‘s not. You‘re either moving forward or backward. Maintenance is an illusion. You must chart your 
progress in writing and pay attention to the direction you‘re heading. If it‘s the wrong direction, 
change it quickly! 
Natural bodybuilders and physique athletes are great role models to study because they‘ve 
developed incredible sensitivity to the way they look and feel. They have the uncanny ability to notice 
the slightest difference in their bodies when they change their nutrition or training programs. This 
enables them to decide whether the change was effective or not. Without this skill, your program 
could be working and you might not even notice. Or worse, it might not be working—and you don‘t 
notice! 
Sensory acuity is an art and a skill that takes time to develop, but anyone can master it. You simply 
need to know what to look for and then pay attention. You have already learned a major part of it—
look for changes in body composition, not just body weight—and you‘ll learn more in this chapter. 
The rest comes from personal experience. 
Ultimately, you need to learn how your own body responds and then make adjustments. You must 
become your own expert. Good coaches and trainers are always helpful, but no one knows your body 
like you do. Once you‘ve locked onto a winning strategy and you‘re getting the results you want, 
don‘t change a thing. Stay your course, no matter what anyone tells you. 
6. If it’s not working, do something else. 
The moment you realize you aren‘t making progress, you must immediately adjust your approach. 
Don‘t get discouraged. If you didn‘t get the result you wanted, remember: You didn‘t fail; rather, you 
succeeded at producing a result. You‘ve only failed if you quit. Use the feedback as a lesson. Once 
you see that what you‘re doing isn‘t working and you recognize it as nothing more than feedback, then 
try something different. Throughout the rest of this book, you‘ll learn about all the options you have 
for changing your strategy when things aren‘t working the way you planned. This will become 
especially important if you hit a progress plateau. (Chapter 18 is devoted entirely to plateau-breaking 
strategies.) 
7. Be flexible in your approach and be persistent. 

================================================================================
Be willing to adjust your approach as many times as necessary until you reach your goal. Be willing to 
try as many different things as necessary for as long as it takes. Don‘t do what it takes for your 
training partner, your neighbor, your spouse, or anyone else. Do what it takes for you. 
Motivational speaker and best-selling author Anthony Robbins tells the story of a man at a seminar 
who was extremely frustrated with his lack of business results. He said he‘d tried ―everything,‖ but 
nothing worked. 
ROBBINS: ―You‘ve tried EVERYTHING???‖ 
ATTENDEE: ―Yes, I‘ve tried absolutely everything!‖ 
ROBBINS: ―Tell me the last HUNDRED things you tried.‖ 
ATTENDEE: ―I haven‘t tried a hundred things.‖ 
ROBBINS: ―OK, then just tell me the last FIFTY things you tried.‖ 
ATTENDEE: ―I haven‘t tried fifty things.‖ 
ROBBINS: ―All right then, tell me the last DOZEN things you tried.‖ 
ATTENDEE (getting somewhat embarrassed): ―Well, I haven‘t tried a dozen things.‖ 
ROBBINS: ―I thought you said you tried EVERYTHING! So tell me then, how many things HAVE 
you tried?‖ 
ATTENDEE (red-faced, shrinking back into his seat): ―Two or three.‖ 
Ask yourself: ―How persistent have I been?‖ Be honest. Have you quit prematurely? Did you give 
up at the first obstacle? How many different training and nutrition strategies have you tried? If your 
initial plan doesn‘t give you the results you want, the number of nutrition and training variations you 
can try is virtually unlimited. Don‘t be too rigid in your approach. Be flexible. It‘s necessary to have 
an action plan, but don‘t get married to your first plan. The more options you have at your disposal, 
the greater your chances for success. Leave yourself room to improvise. 
DEVELOPING YOUR OWN PERSONAL FORMULA OR 
PHILOSOPHY 
In developing the martial art of Jeet Kune Do, Bruce Lee worked hard to create a philosophy for self-
defense and personal growth. His method had four simple steps: 
1.  Research your own experience. 
2.  Absorb what is useful. 
3.  Reject what is useless. 
4.  Add what is specifically your own. 
Lee explained, 
Formulas can only inhibit freedom; externally dictated prescriptions only squelch creativity 
and assure mediocrity … Learning is definitely not mere imitation, nor is it the ability to 
accumulate and regurgitate fixed knowledge. Learning is a constant process of discovery, a 
process without end. 

================================================================================
Beware of rigid programs or dogmatic gurus who declare, ―It‘s my way or the highway.‖ There is 
no single best way. By studying, reading, and modeling experts, you can quickly master all the 
universal principles and laws that regulate body composition. Once you‘ve mastered the fundamentals, 
then through action, persistence, and sensory acuity you can do what Bruce Lee did and develop your 
own philosophy. 
Your personal formula will unfold based on your unique body type and the way you respond to 
various combinations of nutrition and training. By transcending all rigid styles and systems, you‘ll no 
longer be bound by a particular way of doing things and you‘ll gain the freedom to reach your highest 
potential. 
THE TOP TEN WAYS TO GET PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK 
The more feedback you get and the more ways you have to measure results, the better. Here are ten 
feedback tools to gauge your progress; just remember that body composition is the ideal measure: 
TEN FEEDBACK TOOLS TO MEASURE YOUR PROGRESS 
  1.  Body fat percentage 
  2.  Skinfold thickness 
  3.  Total body weight 
  4.  Lean body mass (LBM) 
  5.  Fat weight 
  6.  How you look in the mirror 
  7.  Before and after photographs 
  8.  Measurements (tape measure) 
  9.  Clothing sizes and how clothes fit 
10.  Other people‘s opinions 
The mirror and photographs are useful, but they‘re subject to the filter of your self-perceptions. 
Other people‘s opinions will help if the feedback is honest, but they can steer you wrong if they‘re just 
being nice to avoid hurting your feelings. The fit of your clothes, especially your waistline, is a great 
feedback tool, but remember that growing muscles can make clothes feel tighter. 
All these methods have value, so use as many as you can, but it‘s important to always include 
objective body composition measurements. Together, the skinfold caliper and scale don‘t lie. 
HOW TO USE A WEEKLY PROGRESS CHART 
Your Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle progress chart has columns for the date, body fat percentage, total 
weight, lean body mass, fat weight, and weekly change in each. You can also create your own custom 

================================================================================
chart on a spreadsheet. If you‘re using a caliper as your testing method, you may also want to track 
skinfold measurements (in millimeters). That will inform you about where you store most of your fat 
and where you are losing the most and least fat. Seeing the previous skinfold measurements also helps 
the tester improve the accuracy of each pinch test. 
When you start the program, weigh yourself and have your body fat measured. Then fill in the first 
row on your chart, including the date, your starting body weight, your body fat percentage, and your 
lean body mass. You can also take circumference measurements if you choose. Every week, recheck 
your progress and update your chart, including the change from last week. 
How to Weigh Yourself the Right Way 
By itself, the scale can be misleading, but together with skinfold testing to measure pounds of fat and 
muscle your body weight gives you crucial information. 
To get the most consistent weigh-in, always weigh yourself under the same conditions. Measure 
yourself on the same scale on the same day of the week at the same time of day, wearing the same 
amount of clothes. If you weigh yourself with shoes, then weigh yourself with shoes every time. If you 
weigh yourself naked, weigh yourself naked every time. Remember, your LBM and fat weight 
amounts will be correct only if your weigh-in is correct. Call this your official weekly weigh-in. I 
recommend Mondays because that tends to keep you in check on the weekends, the time that most 
people are liable to fall off the wagon. 
Weighing yourself every day is optional for two reasons. First, you won‘t see significant changes in 
body fat on a day-to-day basis. Second, your body weight can fluctuate from day to day based on your 
hydration level. Daily fluctuations can range anywhere from two to five pounds or more from water 
weight alone. You‘ll see a statistically significant difference every seven days, so I recommend an 
official weigh-in once a week. If you‘re the analytical type, you can certainly weigh yourself daily if 
you want more data points. Just be sure to use that data to chart the trends or moving averages and 
don‘t get overly concerned with daily fluctuations. 
HOW TO CALCULATE MUSCLE LOSS OR GAIN 
By tracking changes in your weight, body fat, and lean mass over time, you can tell if you‘ve lost, 
maintained, or gained muscle. This reveals whether your exercise and diet program is really working 
or if you‘ve hit a plateau and need to make changes. 
To calculate the change in your body composition over time, you simply subtract your previous 
weight, body fat, and lean mass from your current weight, body fat, and lean mass. Record this 
information on your progress chart and then decide what changes, if any, you need to make. 
Example 
WEEK ONE: 
Weight: 194 pounds 
Body fat: 21.1% 
Fat weight: 40.9 pounds 
Lean mass: 153.1 pounds 
WEEK TWO: 

================================================================================
Weight: 192 pounds 
Body fat: 20.5% 
Fat weight: 39.3 pounds 
Lean mass: 152.7 pounds 
Change in weight: −2 pounds 
Change in body fat: −0.6% 
Change in fat weight: −1.6 pounds 
Change in lean mass: −0.4 pounds 
In this example, Joe, our test subject, lost two pounds in one week. By taking a body fat 
measurement, we see that 1.6 pounds of Joe‘s weight loss came from fat, and 0.4 pounds came from 
lean body mass. This isn‘t ideal, because he lost a little bit of lean mass, but it‘s not that bad either. 
It‘s not uncommon to see an occasional drop in lean mass and it is unusual for most people (unless 
they‘re very heavy) to lose more than two or three pounds per week every week with 100 percent fat 
loss. 
WHY YOU SHOULD WEIGH YOURSELF AND MEASURE BODY 
FAT ON A WEEKLY BASIS 
Some experts believe that testing body fat every week is too often. They argue that weekly changes 
are so small, why bother? That may be a valid point, but if you don‘t capture performance feedback 
frequently, you could waste valuable time heading in the wrong direction. If a plane or ship strayed 
even a few degrees off course without making a quick adjustment in direction, that small deviation 
would grow larger over time until eventually it could end up hundreds of miles from its intended 
destination. Don‘t let that happen to you. Measure your progress weekly and make course corrections 
as often as necessary. 
WHAT A DECREASE IN LEAN BODY MASS TELLS YOU 
As you fill out the rows in your progress chart each week, keep an eye on your LBM, especially the 
trend over time. Most people drop some water weight in the beginning, especially if they‘re restricting 
carbs, and this may show up in the LBM number. You can‘t measure water weight, muscle weight, 
and fat weight separately with a skinfold test, so when your start your program, chalk up that initial 
LBM drop to water weight and don‘t be too concerned. 
Water balance can affect your weight in the opposite direction too. If you eat more carbs than usual 
one day, and also increase your fluid or sodium intake, it‘s not uncommon to see an increase in body 
weight of three to five pounds, especially if you were dehydrated or on low carbs. Your chart will 
show a several-pound gain in LBM, but obviously that overnight weight gain wasn‘t solid muscle. 
This simply reflects glycogen and water in the muscles. 
This is why you must be consistent with your weigh-ins and why you shouldn‘t panic if you see a 
small or occasional drop in LBM. If your LBM continues to drop week after week in any significant 
amount, you may have cause for concern. A continual downward trend over time in your LBM 
number clearly shows that you‘re losing muscle tissue. 
Also look at your ratio of fat lost to lean mass lost. If you lose more lean mass than fat, that‘s 
usually a sign that some of the weight was muscle tissue. For example, if you lose 4 pounds in one 

================================================================================
week with 1.8 pounds from fat and 2.2 pounds from lean mass, don‘t pat yourself on the back for 
losing more weight than average: You lost more LBM than fat. 
WEEKLY FLUCTUATIONS AND THE TREND OVER TIME 
You‘ll rarely reach your goal in a straight line from start to finish. If you work hard, you‘ll see 
progress every week, but your rate of progress usually varies. One week you may lose 0.5 percent 
body fat, the next 0.8 percent, and the next only 0.3 percent. On some weeks you might not make any 
progress. Don‘t let this discourage you. Never panic over a one-week fluctuation. The trend over time 
is much more revealing. 
Your progress chart is a lot like the stock market. The market fluctuates up and down in the short 
term, but in the long run the trend is always upward. If you‘re persistent—if you stay focused on the 
fundamentals and continue to make daily investments in your body—your progress will trend in a 
positive direction. 
Just as you need faith in long-term market investments, you must have faith in long-term 
investments in your body without getting emotional about short-term results. If you look at one small 
segment on your progress chart, you‘re liable to give up or make poor and hasty decisions. Keep your 
eye on the big picture, keep watching the trends, and keep working hard on the fundamentals every 
single day. 
ANALYZING PROGRESS DATA AND ADJUSTING YOUR 
APPROACH 
When you get to the chapter on how to break plateaus, it will become even clearer how important it is 
to track progress. The beauty of seeing the numbers on a chart is that combined with visual 
assessments, you know it the instant you‘re stuck. By looking at the changes in body fat, weight, and 
lean mass, and reconciling these with your past week‘s training and nutrition and the trend over time, 
you also know exactly what to do next to get unstuck. 
Your progress chart is also a great motivational tool, because nobody likes to see a blemish on their 
weekly ―report card.‖ Your progress chart is a tool for self-accountability as well. If you share your 
chart with someone else, whether that‘s a coach, trainer, friend, or family member, then you have 
double the accountability and this will help you stick with your program even better. 
After your weekly results update, look at your progress chart and, based on the past week‘s results, 
adjust your cardio, weight training, and nutrition if necessary. Each time you make a change, watch 
carefully for what happens every day during the following week. This will increase your sensory 
acuity skill. If you develop a keen eye for changes in your body based on changes to your nutrition 
and training, you‘ll eventually become a master at this, just like the fitness pros. 
The more you pay attention to the weekly feedback and progress data, the better you get at applying 
progression and troubleshooting problems. You may reach a point when you anticipate what will 
happen next and you stay a step ahead of the curve, dodging plateaus before they happen and reaching 
your goal at the fastest possible rate. 
Ultimately, you can become so skilled at this process, you won‘t have to track weight and body 
composition anymore. Everything in this program can become instinctual with enough repetition and 
practice. 

================================================================================
INTERPRETING YOUR PROGRESS CHART 
There are many results you can produce from various combinations of nutrition and training combined 
with your overall lifestyle. Each week, your weight, body fat, and lean mass could all rise, fall, or stay 
the same. This final section lists every possible outcome you may encounter on your fat-loss journey 
and the action steps to take when each occurs. 
LEAN MASS STAYS THE SAME AND BODY FAT DECREASES 
Fantastic! Your nutrition and training program is working as planned and you‘re on your way to 
reaching your goal. Don‘t change anything. Keep up the good work! 
LEAN MASS STAYS THE SAME AND BODY FAT STAYS THE SAME 
Nothing is happening either way; you are in energy balance, so you must create a caloric deficit. First, 
double-check your nutrition compliance and track calories carefully. Then increase your calorie burn 
from cardio. You can increase intensity, duration, or frequency, depending on the volume of your 
current cardio program. If you don‘t lose body fat within the next week, then you can reduce your 
daily caloric intake systematically by 100 to 200 calories at a time, provided you don‘t drop below 
your maximum allowable calorie deficit. 
Keep your nutrient ratios the same unless you‘ve been stuck for more than two weeks. If you‘ve 
been on the program for months and you‘ve been stuck more than two weeks, you might want to 
experiment with reducing carbs or cycling carbs (see Chapter 19 for details). 
LEAN MASS STAYS THE SAME AND BODY FAT INCREASES 
You‘re in a calorie surplus. You‘re eating more than you‘re burning and storing the excess as fat. 
Double-check your nutrition compliance and track calories carefully; you may have underestimated 
how much you ate. Reduce your daily caloric intake by 100 to 200 calories. Keep your nutrient ratios 
the same and keep your food choices as natural as possible. Recheck your body fat in one week. If it 
hasn‘t decreased, increase the intensity of your cardio. If your cardio volume is low, you can also 
increase the frequency or duration. 
LEAN MASS DECREASES AND BODY FAT DECREASES 
You‘re losing body fat, which is good, but you‘ve also lost some lean mass. If this is the first time 
you‘ve lost LBM, it may be water weight and nothing to worry about. If this is a recurring pattern and 
you‘ve been losing LBM more than two weeks in a row, you‘re losing muscle and you need to eat 
more, at least temporarily. Make sure your protein intake is adequate. Increase your daily caloric 
intake by 100 to 200 calories, or increase your calories all the way to maintenance once every fourth 
day (carb cycling method) while continuing your current training program. Be certain that your weight 
training is consistent and that each workout is intense, focused, and progressive. 
LEAN MASS DECREASES AND BODY FAT STAYS THE SAME OR INCREASES 
It‘s unlikely that your LBM will decrease and your body fat will increase in the same week. Double-
check your body fat testing and scale accuracy and consider that this measurement could be an 
anomaly. If this outcome is confirmed, you may be in a hormonally suboptimal and catabolic state. 
This may occur due to overtraining, exhaustion, poor nutrition, or ignoring important lifestyle factors 
such as adequate sleep and stress control. 

================================================================================
Stay on a consistent eating plan without missing meals. Make sure your protein intake is adequate. 
If you lost no weight, you can increase cardio slightly and/or decrease calories slightly, unless your 
calories were already very low. 
Make sure you‘re consistent with your weight training. Make the weight training sessions short and 
intense, and be sure to recover adequately from your training. Get enough sleep and consider stress 
management techniques. 
LEAN MASS INCREASES AND BODY FAT INCREASES 
You gained muscle, which is good, but you also gained fat. This is common among off-season 
bodybuilders; it‘s called ―bulking up,‖ where the athlete gains unwanted fat while gaining muscle. If 
this happens, especially for more than one week, you are clearly in a calorie surplus. If your goal is to 
burn fat, you need to decrease calories significantly to establish a deficit. Try dropping 200 to 400 
calories from your daily intake. Watch your weight during the week. Remeasure in one week. If your 
body fat hasn‘t started dropping, then repeat. 
Keep your compliance level high, track calories carefully, and keep your eating relatively clean and 
free of calorie-dense high-fat and high-sugar junk foods. If your training volume was low, you can 
also increase the intensity, frequency, or duration of your cardio. 
LEAN MASS INCREASES AND BODY FAT DECREASES 
This is unlikely to happen, except for beginners, genetically gifted individuals (the pure mesomorphic 
body type), and sometimes for ectomorphs with fast metabolisms. If you do gain muscle and lose fat 
in the same week, terrific! Your results are exceptional. Don‘t change anything. Keep up the good 
work; you‘re on your way to reaching or even exceeding your goal. 
LEAN MASS INCREASES AND BODY FAT STAYS THE SAME 
Good job: You‘ve gained muscle without gaining fat! This is the ideal outcome for a muscle-gaining 
program. You are probably in a caloric surplus, at least some of the time. If you also want to reduce 
your body fat percentage, you‘ll need a calorie deficit, which you can accomplish by decreasing your 
calories slightly while keeping your training and activity level the same. If your cardio volume was 
low, you can also increase the frequency, intensity, or duration of each session. 
THE ESSENCE OF THE FEEDBACK SYSTEM: LET YOUR RESULTS 
DICTATE YOUR APPROACH 
I always recommend letting your results dictate your strategy. If you can eat 60 percent or more of 
your calories from carbs and the fat is melting off, great: Keep eating all those carbs, even if a guru 
told you that low-carb is more effective. If you can get lean with nutrition and weight training only 
and almost no cardio, fine: Don‘t do any cardio. Don‘t fix anything that‘s not broken! As long as 
everything you‘re doing is healthy and sustainable, the ends justify the means. The fact is the results 
you produce each week are the only true measure of whether you‘ve made the right choices. Results 
are what count. 
You are unique, and since all four elements of this program—nutrition, cardio training, resistance 
training, and mental training—are customizable, customize them! Don‘t get locked into the freedom-
restricting formulas that so many diets prescribe. When you discover an approach that works for you, 
develop immunity from criticism, disregard unhelpful comments from those who disagree with your 
approach, and judge your success only by your weekly progress. 

================================================================================
By following this system, using body composition measurement, performance feedback, and 
progress charting, you will, through an evolutionary learning process, figure out your body type and 
develop your own personal formula quickly. Once you‘ve discovered your personal formula, it will 
always be there for you for the rest of your life, whenever you want to go back to it. 
QUICK START 
Want an instant increase in results? Do what all great sports coaches and business managers do: 
Measure everything you want to improve. Performance improves when performance is 
measured, so always keep score! Use the progress chart in the appendix to track your body 
composition, get into a feedback loop, and every week adjust your approach according to your 
results. 
LEARN: 
MENTAL TRAINING (The 1
st Element) 
In the previous chapters, we‘ve been setting the stage for you to have total success on this program. Now you‘re getting into the 
heart of the program—starting with the first of the four elements—mental training. This piece of our four-part L.E.A.N. formula 
focuses on setting goals and reprogramming your mind for success. Countless readers have told me that this was the missing 
element for them because until they mastered it, they had never been able to stay focused, stay motivated, and stick with their 
program, ever before. After they mastered it, they were unstoppable! 
Ironically, this is the part that even the most intelligent readers are often tempted to skip, because it seems so logical that the 
secret lies in the food plan or workout routines, not in a motivational talk. Without fail, those who gloss over it the first time and 
fail to get results, eventually realize the paradox that the biggest secret to physical change is mental change. They come back to 
this chapter, follow the instructions to the letter and finally see the results that have eluded them for years. 
I heartily suggest that you not only read Chapter 6 with rapt attention and apply what you learn from day one, but that you 
study this material and absolutely master it. The payoff is immeasurable and goes far beyond more muscle and better abs. These 
techniques are transferrable—they can help you become successful in every area of your life. 
 
 
 

================================================================================
CHAPTER 6 
Setting Goals and Training Your Mind 
The strangest secret in the world is that you become what you think about. 
—Earl Nightingale 
THE SIMPLE FIRST STEP YOU MUST TAKE BEFORE YOU START 
ANY NUTRITION OR EXERCISE PROGRAM 
This might be the most important element in the entire program, even though it has nothing to do with 
calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, cardio, weights, or anything else related to nutrition or training. 
You see, there‘s a simple but critical procedure you must complete before you lift a weight, jog a mile, 
create a meal plan, or set foot in a gym. If you successfully complete this procedure, the nutrition and 
training will come naturally and a lean body will soon follow. If you ignore this step, like most people, 
you will likely fail no matter what you do or how hard you try. 
The crucial first step is setting a goal. 
Much has been said about goal setting—entire books have been devoted to the subject—but the 
truth is most people never decide exactly what they want. Some give their goals a fleeting thought, but 
most never get specific and commit their dreams and desires to writing. ―Most people,‖ says Denis 
Waitley, author of The Psychology of Winning, ―spend more time planning a party, studying the 
newspaper, or making a Christmas list than they do planning their lives.‖ According to the late Zig 
Ziglar, a goal-setting expert who was one of the nation‘s most respected motivational speakers, only 3 
percent of Americans have actually taken the time and effort necessary to put their goals on paper. 
This is unfortunate because the number one reason for failure in losing body fat—and in life—is the 
lack of clearly defined, written goals. Ziglar compared not having goals to shooting at a target with a 
blindfold on: ―How could you possibly hit a target you can‘t even see?‖ If you don‘t know where 
you‘re going, you‘ll probably end up nowhere! Action without planning is one of the biggest causes of 
failure. 
I want to share with you the most powerful goal-achieving formula in the world. But before I do, 
you first need to understand the hidden reasons why goal setting is so important to your success in the 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle program. 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING WHAT TO DO AND 
DOING WHAT YOU KNOW 
Nutrition and exercise can be confusing subjects. When you first get started, the initial challenge is 
that you don‘t know what to do. With this program in your hands, knowing what to do is no longer a 
problem. However, gaining knowledge is only half the battle. The far greater challenge for most 
people is applying that knowledge and taking action. There‘s a big difference between knowing what 
to do and doing what you know. A goal is the bridge that spans this gap. 

================================================================================
Goals, when properly planted in your subconscious mind, provide direction and stimulate action. 
Goals create energy and motivation. Goals get you out of bed early in the morning and into the gym. 
Goals keep you going when you feel like quitting. The secret to staying motivated all the time is to set 
emotionally charged goals, commit them to writing, and stay focused on those goals day and night. A 
goal with a purpose is the fuel that propels you forward. 
You might think you‘re in total conscious control of your behavior, but it‘s really your 
subconscious that‘s running the show. If you know what to do but you can‘t get yourself to do it, 
you‘ve probably been giving negative or conflicting messages to your subconscious mind. Repeated 
behaviors produced by subconscious conditioning are more commonly referred to as habits. 
Fortunately, you can reprogram your subconscious mind with positive instructions and become a 
creature of positive habit, just as easily as you can become a victim of negative habits. It all begins 
with a conscious decision and written goals. 
THE POWER OF THOUGHT 
After competing in dozens of bodybuilding competitions and helping thousands of people with 
training and nutrition programs, I‘m convinced that the most important part of getting in great shape is 
simply making up your mind to do it. You get in shape by setting goals and thinking about them all 
day long. I know that may sound a little strange, but stay with me for a minute and I‘ll explain. 
I‘m not saying you can ―think yourself thin.‖ No amount of positive thinking will help without 
action. Obviously you have to exercise and eat the right foods in the right amounts. What I‘m 
suggesting is that if you don‘t channel your mental energies properly, even the best nutrition or 
training program is useless because you will always sabotage yourself. 
Did you ever wonder why you‘ve had lapses in willpower? Or why some days you just couldn‘t 
drag yourself to the gym? Or why you fell off the diet wagon? Or why you couldn‘t say no to 
chocolate or that second helping of food? It‘s because negative programming in your subconscious 
mind was controlling your behavior. 
This is not some New Age or Pollyanna mentality: There are valid scientific reasons why goal 
setting works. Goals work because they harness and direct the awesome power of your subconscious 
mind, which guides your behavior on autopilot. 
HOW YOUR ―MENTAL COMPUTER‖ IS PROGRAMMED FOR 
SUCCESS OR FAILURE 
Your mind has two components: the conscious and the subconscious. The conscious mind is the 
rational, logical, analytical, thinking part of the mind. It‘s constantly taking in information from the 
five senses, and then it reasons, analyzes, and concludes whether the input is true or false. The 
subconscious is the part of the mind responsible for storing data (memory) and for automatic behavior 
(habits), reflexes, and the body‘s autonomic functions such as digestion, breathing, and circulation. 
Unlike the conscious mind, your subconscious does not think or reason. It‘s entirely deductive in 
nature, and it works like a computer. All the data programmed into your subconscious computer is 
accepted as a command. It doesn‘t matter whether the input is actually true or false; everything that 
reaches the subconscious is assumed to be true. Your mental programming is then carried out in the 
form of behaviors the same way a computer executes its programming. 
Suggestions given under hypnosis or visualization during deep relaxation are quick ways to access 
the subconscious mind. Another way to penetrate the subconscious (although much slower) is through 

================================================================================
spaced repetition. Everything you hear, see, say, read, or think repeatedly eventually filters into your 
subconscious mind, especially if it‘s repeated with emotion. In other words, you are constantly 
programming your brain through conscious self-suggestion—or you are allowing your brain to be 
programmed through unconscious external suggestion. That’s why you must take conscious control 
over programming your own brain. 
The basis for positive thinking and philosophies such as the law of attraction is that the 
subconscious is amenable to suggestion. People who say that positive thoughts and affirmations don‘t 
work aren‘t using them effectively or consistently, or they‘re wishing for the positive while thinking 
about the negative. 
If a captain gives an order such as ―Go east,‖ then keeps changing his mind—―No, go west … no, 
go north‖—the ship would never get anywhere! This is also why most people get nowhere with their 
fitness, weight loss, or muscle-building endeavors. Ironically, the very statement ―Positive thinking 
doesn‘t work‖ is a negative suggestion guaranteeing that it won‘t work! 
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REASON MOST PEOPLE SABOTAGE 
THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO LOSE BODY FAT 
The conscious mind is a lot like the captain at the bridge of a ship. The captain sends a command to 
the engine room. The subconscious mind is like the people down in the engine room. No matter what 
orders come down from the bridge (conscious mind), the crew obeys, even if the orders are stupid 
ones that crash the ship into a rocky shore. The reason this happens is because the crew (the 
subconscious) can‘t see where the ship is going; they are simply following orders. 
Like the ship‘s crew, your subconscious mind carries out every command it accepts from your 
conscious mind. Its sole purpose is to obey your orders, even if you give ones like ―I‘ll always be fat.‖ 
Frequent repetition of thoughts (mental orders) is one certain way to penetrate the subconscious mind. 
By constantly repeating negative commands such as ―I can‘t lose weight,‖ your subconscious will see 
to it that you never lose weight because that‘s its job: to follow your every command literally and 
without question. If you program your mind with negative suggestions often enough, it will lead you 
right into cheating on your diet, skipping workouts, or some other form of self-sabotage. 
Dr. Maxwell Maltz, author of the incredible book Psycho-Cybernetics, described the human brain 
and nervous system as a ―perfect goal-striving servo-mechanism.‖ This mechanism helps you achieve 
your goals much like a self-guided torpedo or missile seeks out its target and navigates to it. Like the 
torpedo, the cybernetic mechanism in your brain can only work in your favor if you‘ve chosen a 
target. 
Without a target, your mental ―servo-mechanism‖ simply steers you toward your dominant 
thoughts. The subconscious mind is always at work 24 hours a day, whether you direct it consciously 
or not. Denis Waitley says, ―Since we become what we think of most of the time, whatever we are 
thinking of now, we are unconsciously moving toward the achievement of that thought. For an 
alcoholic, this could be the next drink; for a drug addict, the next fix; for a surfer, the next wave. 
Divorce, bankruptcy, and illness are all goals spawned out of negative attitudes and thought patterns.‖ 
THE POWER OF FOCUS 
Because of how your subconscious operates, it‘s crucial to focus on what you want to achieve, not on 
what you want to avoid. This isn‘t just semantics; it‘s a vital distinction with deep implications for fat 
loss. If I tell you, ―Don‘t think about pink elephants,‖ you have to think about pink elephants because 

================================================================================
your brain can‘t process negation. You either think about something or you don‘t, and you always 
move toward what you think about the most, whether it‘s positive or negative. 
Like the soil, your subconscious mind is totally impartial; it doesn‘t discriminate. In it will grow 
whatever seeds you plant there or allow to be planted there. Many people have perfectly good 
intentions, but they unwittingly allow their subconscious to work against themselves by thinking and 
talking about what they don‘t want. And as metaphysical writer Louise Hay reminds us, ―The more 
you dwell on what you don‘t want, the more of it you create.‖ Others simply pay no attention to their 
thoughts whatsoever, and like a garden that‘s neglected, soon enough, weeds start growing. Eventually 
the weeds take over their garden. 
Here are a few examples of negative statements and self-defeating questions: 
I can’t lose weight no matter what I do. 
Why can’t I lose these last ten pounds? 
Why is it so hard for me to lose weight? 
I have a slow metabolism. 
I’ll always be fat. 
It’s not my fault I’m fat because I don’t have good genetics. 
I don’t want to be fat anymore. 
I wish I could get rid of this gut. 
It’ll never work because I love food too much. 
I don’t have the willpower to get lean. 
I would work out but I don’t have time. 
I just can’t get myself up that early to work out. 
I hate being fat. 
I’m sick of being overweight. 
I’m tired of working out but getting nowhere. 
I’m ready to give up. 
I’ll never see my abs. 
I hate cardio. 
I can’t. 
I’ll try. 
All day long you carry on a mental conversation with yourself. Psychologists estimate that we think 
up to 60,000 thoughts a day and that 98 percent of these thoughts are the same ones we had 
yesterday—most of them negative. In a year, that‘s almost 22 million thoughts! If Madison Avenue 
advertising giants can influence your subconscious mind to make a buying decision by repeating an ad 
a mere two dozen times (they can), then imagine the impact that millions of your own ―thought 
commands‖ have on influencing your subconscious mind. It‘s staggering! That‘s why it‘s so important 
to take conscious control over your speech and mental dialogue and program your brain with positive 
instructions. 
Fortunately, the one thing in life you always have total control over is your thoughts. After all, it‘s 
your brain, right? If you want to be successful at getting leaner or any other endeavor in life, you must 
master your communication with yourself. You must take charge of your self-talk, ―police‖ your 
thinking, and literally reprogram your brain for success. If you‘ve cluttered your mind with a lifetime 

================================================================================
of ―stinkin‘ thinkin‘,‖ as Mr. Ziglar called it, this may be challenging at first. It will take time to 
overwrite the old programming, but it can be done. 
The first step is to become conscious of what you are thinking and saying. Become more aware of 
your thoughts and your language. The instant you catch yourself in the middle of a negative thought or 
self-defeating question, interrupt it! Slam on the brakes like a car heading for a cliff and stop that train 
of thought! Mentally imagine a big rubber stamp that says ―CANCEL‖ and stamp it out. Bob Proctor, 
a master success coach and creator of the Goal Achiever program, suggests saying ―NEXT‖ or 
―SWITCH‖ the instant you notice a negative thought, then immediately replacing it with a positive 
thought, affirmation, or question. Soon you‘ll find that your mind switches polarity and the negative 
thoughts pop up less. 
Here are some examples of how you could change negative self-talk to positive self-talk: 
How can I burn fat and enjoy the process? 
What can I do today to get me closer to my ideal weight? 
What can I eat right now at this meal that will help me burn body fat? 
How great am I going to feel after I finish my workout today? 
My metabolism is getting faster every day. 
I am getting leaner every day. 
I like the way I look. 
I am 100 percent responsible for my results. 
I am doing whatever it takes. 
I like eating healthy foods. 
I love working out. 
Training early in the morning is exhilarating. 
I have time for anything I’m committed to. 
I am unstoppable. 
I like myself. 
I’m the best. 
I can. 
I’ll do it. 
THE MOST POWERFUL GOAL-ACHIEVING FORMULA IN THE 
WORLD 
In the beginning of this chapter, I promised to reveal the most powerful goal-achieving formula in the 
world. Now that you understand the nature of your subconscious mind and why goal setting works, 
you‘re ready to learn the formula. 
1. Set specific goals. 
When I ask people what they want to achieve from their fitness programs, I usually get vague answers 
like ―I want to get leaner,‖ ―I want to lose weight,‖ and ―I want to build muscle.‖ Those are good 
starts, but they‘re too general. Specific goals have a more powerful impact on your subconscious. A 

================================================================================
vague goal is like the captain of a ship saying, ―Go west.‖ The ship may be headed in the right general 
direction, but without a specific destination, it will probably get lost at sea. 
Narrow it down. Exactly how many pounds do you want to lose? When do you want to achieve 
your goal? How much body fat do you want to burn off? How much do you want to weigh? What 
measurements would you like to have? What size clothes do you want to wear? 
2. Set measurable goals. 
You must have a way to objectively measure your progress, otherwise you‘ll never know if you‘ve 
actually reached your goals. The mirror is a useful tool, because ultimately the only thing that matters 
is that you‘re happy with the way you look. However, because you perceive changes in your body so 
subjectively, it‘s helpful to have other ways to measure your results. 
The scale is also a useful tool, but it doesn‘t give you 100 percent of the feedback you need. You 
should be interested not so much in what you weigh as in how much body fat you carry. The ideal 
method to measure your progress is body composition testing. Body fat can be measured easily using 
a skinfold test. Chapter 3 discusses body composition testing methods in more detail, and Chapter 4 
teaches you how to chart your progress and interpret the results. 
3. Set big goals. 
Far too often, people shortchange themselves and make statements like ―I could never look like that‖ 
and ―I‘m too old.‖ Other people buy into the low expectations of well-meaning family or friends who 
tell them to ―be realistic.‖ Nothing great was ever achieved by being realistic! Most people get scared 
when setting goals and ask only for what they think they can get, not what they really want. This is a 
mistake, because puny goals are not motivating. Wants are motivating. 
It‘s okay if your goal scares you a little. In fact, if your goal isn‘t scary and exciting at the same 
time, then your goal is too small. Thinking about a big goal you‘ve never achieved before is always 
going to make you feel a little uncomfortable and afraid. This makes most people pull back into their 
comfort zones. Don‘t let fear of failure or the feeling of discomfort prevent you from going after what 
you really want. Always step forward into growth; never pull back into safety. Refuse to sell yourself 
short. Raise your standards. The architect Daniel Burnham said, ―Make no small plans; they have no 
magic to stir your blood to action. Make big plans, aim high in work and hope.‖ 
Don‘t be afraid to think big and set your sights high, because you can only hit what you aim at! 
Decide what you would like to look like if you could have any body you wanted. See the picture in 
your mind. Make it clear, vivid, and dynamic. Dream. Fantasize. You‘ve been endowed with an 
amazing creative faculty called imagination. Use it. It‘s the starting point of a new self-image and all 
lasting changes. 
There are genetic limits to what each person can achieve athletically and physically. Yet, most 
people never reach their full potential because they don‘t believe it‘s possible, so they don‘t even try. 
It‘s more a question of willingness than genetics. Don‘t ask yourself, ―Is it possible to reach this 
goal?‖ Instead ask, ―How can I achieve this goal?‖ and ―Am I willing to pay the price necessary to 
achieve this goal?‖ You can always find a way if you keep asking how and you can accomplish 
virtually anything if you‘re willing to pay the price. 
4. Set realistic deadlines. 
―Lose 30 pounds in 30 days!‖ ―Lose 10 pounds this weekend!‖ You see ads for quick weight loss like 
these in magazines and all over the Internet, and they sure are enticing. But is it possible? Can you 

================================================================================
really lose weight that fast? It is possible. However, if your goal is losing that much weight in that 
little time, you could be making a big mistake. The real question is: What kind of weight? 
Anything that dehydrates you can cause quick weight loss. You could easily drop 10 pounds over 
the weekend if you stopped drinking water. Of course, that would be pretty dumb and possibly 
dangerous, but the same thing often happens on rapid weight loss diets: They‘re simply dehydrating 
you. Even worse, you may lose muscle as well. Your goal should be fat loss, not weight loss. 
What‘s a realistic rate of fat loss? The American College of Sports Medicine, one of the largest and 
most respected health, medical, and exercise organizations in the world, has established guidelines for 
healthy weight loss. In their position statement ―Proper and Improper Weight-Loss Programs,‖ they 
recommend a weight loss goal of 1 to 2 pounds per week. 
It‘s possible to lose more than two pounds of pure fat per week, especially if you have a lot of 
weight to lose, but usually a large part of any weight loss over 2 or 3 pounds per week is water and 
lean body mass. If you lose water weight, you‘ll gain it back immediately as soon as you rehydrate 
yourself. If you lose muscle, you lose strength, your metabolism slows down, and your body starts to 
look soft. 
Don‘t be afraid to set big goals. Whether that big goal is to shed 100 pounds of fat or to compete in 
a fitness competition, don‘t sell yourself short! But always set realistic time frames for achieving goals 
of this size. Usually, it‘s not the goal that‘s unrealistic but the deadline. Be patient: There are definite 
limitations to how quickly the human body can safely burn fat. 
5. Set long-term and short-term goals. 
As you think about what you want specifically, don‘t just write down one goal; make a list. Your goal 
list should include long-term and short-term goals. There are six types of long- and short-term goals 
you can include: 
1.  Long-term goals and your ultimate ―ideal body‖ 
2.  One-year goals 
3.  Three-month goals 
4.  Weekly goals (weekly body composition tests and weigh-ins) 
5.  Daily goals (habits to develop, behaviors to do every day) 
6.  The goal of continually beating your personal best (personal records or ―PRs‖) 
First, set long-term goals, including your ideal body. What kind of body do you ultimately want to 
have? Let your imagination run wild and dare to dream. Don‘t listen to people who say it can‘t be 
done! You can‘t afford to associate with negative people who always tear you down. If you really 
want it badly and you‘re willing to work for it, then go ahead and set the goal. 
Next, set a one-year goal. A one-year goal is especially important if you have a lot of body fat to 
lose. For example, if your primary objective is to shed 100 pounds, that‘s a 12-month project for most 
people. If you safely and healthfully get it done faster, that‘s great, but if in doubt, give yourself more 
time for big goals like these. Then you‘ll be more likely to surpass your expectations, which is great 
for your motivation. 
Probably your most important goal at any time is your three-month goal. Your three-month goal is 
usually the one you‘ll write down on a goal card and carry around with you, thinking about it and 

================================================================================
visualizing it repeatedly throughout the day. Three months is the perfect time frame for a fat-loss or 
muscle-building goal because it‘s easy to lock in your focus for that long, and a lot can happen in three 
months. A sensible and realistic three-month goal would be to lose about 6 percent body fat and 18 to 
24 pounds. 
The three-month goal is important because long-term goals don‘t have urgency. A one-year goal is 
so far away, you may tend to procrastinate more without the impending deadline. There‘s a 
psychological principle called Parkinson‘s law that says, ―Work expands to fill the time available for 
its completion.‖ Differently stated: ―A task takes as long as there is time to do it.‖ Deadlines are not 
only motivating, they‘re a necessity, because otherwise nothing gets done. Without time pressure, 
you‘ll rationalize missing workouts or cheating on your diet. Your brain will keep saying, ―You have 
plenty of time, so missing this one workout won‘t matter.‖ With a deadline right in front of you, you‘ll 
know that every workout and every meal count. 
You also need to set weekly goals to let you know if you‘re on track. Your weekly results provide 
immediate feedback to tell you whether you‘re moving in the right direction. Each week you should 
weigh yourself and have your body composition measured with a skinfold caliper. If you‘re getting the 
results you want, you simply continue doing what you‘ve been doing. If you‘re not seeing the results 
you want, you can immediately adjust your training or nutrition to get yourself back on course. Any 
time you need guidance on how to adjust your approach each week, review the instructions in Chapter 
5. The answer always lies in the feedback loop system. If you ever feel really stuck, you can use the 
plateau-breaking strategies you‘ll learn in the final part of the program. 
To reach your weekly, three-month, twelve-month, and long-term goals, you must develop positive 
everyday habits. You develop positive habits by setting daily goals (action steps) and repeating them 
until they become behaviors as automatic as brushing your teeth or taking a shower. Write out a list of 
daily goals, to-dos, and action steps you need to take every day in order to reach your midrange and 
long-term goals. This can include good daily habits such as eating lean protein at each meal; including 
fruits or vegetables with each meal; choosing mostly natural, unrefined foods; making your meals in 
advance for each day; and so on. 
Your daily goals can also include developing a schedule or set of daily rituals such as when you‘re 
going to get up in the morning, when you‘re going to work out, what time you‘ll eat your meals, and 
when you‘ll go to sleep at night. Daily goals also include targets for each workout: how long your 
workout will last, how much weight you‘ll lift, how many reps, which exercises, how many minutes of 
cardio, and so forth. You should plan every workout in advance as part of your daily goals. Never 
―wing it.‖ 
Long-term goals are important, but if you look only at the big picture, it can be unsettling to realize 
how much further you have to go. There‘s an old saying about tackling big tasks: ―The only way to eat 
an elephant is one bite at a time.‖ When your larger goals are broken down into smaller parts and you 
focus on each little step one at a time, you won‘t be overwhelmed. ―By the mile it‘s a trial, by the yard 
it‘s hard, but by the inch it‘s a cinch.‖ Take baby steps. Every step you take, no matter how small, will 
give you a feeling of accomplishment and keep your momentum going. The important thing is that 
you‘re moving in the right direction. 
The next time you feel temporarily frustrated, discouraged, or unmotivated, focus on your daily 
goals, not on the huge amount of work that‘s ahead of you. Tell yourself, ―All I have is today. All I 
have is this moment, this workout, this meal, the next 30 minutes, the next hour. If I simply do what I 
know I must do today, then I know I‘ll reach my ultimate goal eventually.‖ As the Zen masters remind 
us, concentrate on the task at hand in the present moment. 
The final type of goal isn‘t so much a goal as it is a mind-set. If you fall into the habit of continually 
comparing yourself to others, this will ensure that you‘re perpetually unhappy and unsatisfied, no 
matter how much you achieve. This is called the law of contrast. There will always be people who are 

================================================================================
stronger, leaner, faster, more athletically talented, and more genetically gifted than you. Comparing 
yourself to them will only make you feel bad. Be inspired by others, but compare yourself only to 
yourself. 
Set goals to become better than you used to be, not become better than someone else. Constantly 
challenge yourself. Keep aiming to beat your previous bests. Training can become fun and exciting 
when you always work on improving yourself. So make it fun; make a contest out of it. Go for one 
more rep, five more pounds, five more minutes, or one level higher on the cardio machine. Aim for 
hitting your lowest body fat ever. Work on constant and never-ending improvement and make this 
process a fun challenge! 
QUICK START 
The goal card is the high-achiever’s secret weapon. Choose your most important, highest-
priority goal for the next three months. Write it down as an affirmation on a pocket-sized card 
and carry it with you everywhere you go. Feel naked without it. Read it as many times a day as 
possible–while you eat breakfast, wait in lines, sit at stoplights, and when you’re on the 
treadmill. It’s the simplest, easiest, yet most powerful tool you can start using today to stay 
focused and train your mind for success. Download a free goal card at

6. Make sure your goals don’t conflict; prioritize and focus on your one most important goal. 
There‘s an ancient Chinese saying: ―He who chases two rabbits catches neither.‖ One of the most 
common obstacles that blocks the way to reaching a goal is setting two or more goals that conflict 
with each other. Training for strength and muscle mass while preparing for long-distance endurance 
events is a perfect example. They‘re not compatible; the endurance work will interfere with the 
strength and muscle gains. 
Many people would love to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. That‘s known as ―body 
recomposition,‖ and it‘s considered the Holy Grail of fitness goals. Although it can be done, it 
requires a more sophisticated approach to cyclical dieting. It‘s also a slower and more difficult process 
than focusing on one thing at a time. Over a period of weeks or months, you might see a small 
increase in muscle with a decrease in body fat, and you‘ll definitely look more muscular as fat is 
stripped away from the muscle you already have underneath. But it‘s not typical to see big increases in 
muscle while you‘re also shedding fat. When it does happen, it‘s usually ―newbie gains.‖ That‘s when 
beginners get better results because their untrained bodies are highly responsive to exercise. As you 
would expect, it also happens more often in genetic superiors (the mesomorphs). 
The most efficient way to get results fast is to put 100 percent of your energy into the one goal 
that‘s most important to you. If your body fat is above average, then your number one goal should be 
shedding fat first, because high body fat is a health risk and it‘s easier to build muscle on a leaner 
body. Once the fat is off, you can rewrite your goals and go into maintenance mode or work on 
gaining lean mass. In the next chapter, where we talk about calories, I‘ll give you a brief introduction 
to how to adjust your plan for gaining muscle. (It would take another book to cover all the details 
about body recomposition or gaining muscle mass.) 
7. Establish the emotional reasons why you want to achieve your goals. 
Almost everyone has days when they don‘t feel like working out or eating the right foods. The secret 
to staying on track at times like these is not just having a goal; it‘s establishing reasons why you want 

================================================================================
that goal—the importance of it. Uncovering the reason you want to achieve something adds emotion 
to it. The more emotion you stir up, the more motivated you‘ll be to go after it. Nietzsche said that if 
you have a strong enough why, you can bear almost any how. 
Getting emotionally involved with your goal also impresses it deeper into your subconscious. 
Whatever idea is fixed in your subconscious will always express itself in physical form: behaviors and 
results. 
Looking good for a wedding or vacation is an important reason why many people want to get in 
shape. So is being attractive to potential life partners. For others, the reason is fear of health 
consequences. (Their doctor tells them if they don‘t lose 50 pounds in the next six months, they‘ll die 
of a heart attack.) Some people want to get healthier so they‘ll live long enough to see their 
grandchildren grow up. 
What are your reasons why you want to achieve your goals? To help you uncover them, answer 
these questions: 
1.  What‘s important to you about reaching your goal? 
2.  Why is that important to you? 
3.  What impact, specifically, will achieving this goal have on your life? (How will your life be 
different and better after you‘ve achieved it?) 
Answering these questions will help you discover the driving force behind your goals and add 
emotional impact to your goal list: 
Who is your fitness role model? 
What do you want to look like? 
Do you want to look like a bodybuilder, an athlete, or a model? 
Do you want to impress anyone? 
Do you want to prove something? 
Do you want to be a role model or set an example? 
Do you want more energy? 
Do you want more mobility so you can enjoy certain sports and activities more? 
Do you want to win a contest or award? 
Do you want more self-confidence? 
Do you want to look great in certain types of clothes? 
Do you want to look good for a certain event (for example, a vacation, a wedding, a reunion, or a 
birthday)? 
Do you want to look great on the beach? 
Do you want to attract someone special into your life? 
8. Write out a goal list in the form of affirmations. 
After setting your goals in terms of a specific weight, body fat, measurement, and so forth, and you 
know the reasons why you want them, the next step is to write all your goals on a sheet of paper or on 
cards in the form of positive statements called affirmations. 
Here are three guidelines to follow when writing your affirmations: 

================================================================================
a)  Make your affirmations personal: Use the word ―I‖ with a verb after it. 
For example: I exercise, I cook, I wake up, I eat, I have, I plan, I enjoy, I lift, I get, I take, I 
deserve, and so on. One of the best ways to start an affirmation is to use the phrase ―I AM.‖ 
Your subconscious responds best to commands given to it in a personal manner. Anything you 
say after ―I AM‖ has power. One of the best affirmations I‘ve ever heard comes from Bob 
Proctor, and it goes like this: ―I am so happy and thankful now that I am ________________‖ 
(fill in your goal). 
b)  Write 
your 
affirmations 
in 
the 
present 
tense. 
To your subconscious mind, there is no future. Your subconscious mind responds best to 
commands given in the present tense. It may feel strange to write a goal this way, but if you 
write it in the future tense (for example, ―Next year I will …‖ or ―I‘m going to …‖), your 
subconscious mind may interpret this literally and keep your goal in the future. For best results, 
write, think, and visualize your goal as if you‘ve already achieved it. 
c)  State 
your 
goal 
in 
positive 
terms. 
Your subconscious moves you toward whatever you focus on, whether it‘s positive or negative. 
Therefore, write what you want, not what you want to avoid or get rid of. For example, instead 
of saying, ―I want to lose 20 pounds,‖ say, ―I weigh 130 pounds with 18 percent body fat.‖ 
9. Read your affirmations (your goal list) at least twice a day and always keep your goals in 
front of you and on your mind. 
Psychologists have proven that repetition is an effective way to penetrate and program the 
subconscious mind. Fortune 500 companies spend billions of advertising dollars every year based on 
this fact. Why is it that people reach for Coke, Pepsi, Budweiser, Marlboro, Crest, Palmolive, and 
other brand-name items? It‘s because the repetition of the advertising has penetrated their 
subconscious minds and moved them to action. 
You can use the power of spaced repetition to influence your own subconscious and move yourself 
to action. After you‘ve written out your affirmations, read your list at least twice a day, once in the 
morning and once at night. Read them more often if you can. If you want to amplify the effect of the 
affirmation technique, don‘t just read your affirmations; write them out by hand every single day or 
record them in your own voice and listen to them regularly. 
After you‘ve set all your goals and written your affirmations, use the power of repetition even more 
by keeping your goals in front of you all day long. Post your goal statements in a conspicuous place, 
such as on your refrigerator, on your bathroom mirror, or in your daily appointment book. Keep a goal 
card of your three-month goals in your pocket. Paste them onto the dashboard of your car. Set them as 
your mobile phone wallpaper. Stick them on top of your computer monitor or make them your desktop 
background and screen saver so you look at them all day long. 
You may have been exposed to this affirmation technique before and shrugged it off as hokey. If so, 
let me ask you this: Did you really give it an honest trial? Did you put it to the test for at least 28 days 
in a row and give 100 percent with positive expectancy? If not, then you‘re denying yourself the 
chance of achieving everything you‘ve ever dreamed of. Don‘t let the simplicity of the affirmation 
technique fool you. Be open-minded and don‘t prejudge it. Affirmations are more powerful than you 
can imagine, but they don‘t work when you just ―try‖ them once or twice. They won‘t work even if 
you do them for a few days. They won‘t work if you say them and then cancel them out with negative 
affirmations. They work when you continue to repeat them with faith, emotion, and belief over and 
over again so many times that they replace your old, negative, internal dialogue. 

================================================================================
The ultimate purpose of using affirmations is to help you permanently change the ―tape‖ that loops 
in your mind every day. When you reach the point where your affirmations become your new habitual 
way of thinking and speaking, the results will astound you and what you‘ve been imagining will start 
to materialize in your life. 
10. Read your goals with faith. 
William James, the father of American psychology, wrote, ―The subconscious will bring into reality 
any picture held continually in your mind and backed by faith.‖ Napoleon Hill, author of Think and 
Grow Rich and The Law of Success, said, ―All thoughts which have been emotionalized and mixed 
with faith begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent.‖ Faith, which is 
simply an unshakeable belief, is yet another way to plant your desires in your subconscious mind. 
Faith is when you believe in what you can‘t see. Faith is when you know you‘ll eventually reach 
your goal, even though you look in the mirror and see that little has changed yet. The opposite of faith 
is doubt. Shakespeare wrote, ―Our doubts are our traitors / And make us lose the good we oft might 
win / By fearing to attempt.‖ The poet William Blake wrote, ―If the Sun & Moon should Doubt, / 
They‘d immediately Go Out …‖ You must practice believing in yourself, or ―banishing the doubt,‖ as 
inspirational author Wayne Dyer calls it. 
How do you cultivate this attribute of faith? Act as if. Read affirmation statements written in the 
present tense as if they were already achieved. See mental pictures of yourself as if you have already 
achieved your goal. When you look in the mirror every day, see what you want to become, not what is 
presently there. Behave as if you were already there. Speak as if you‘ve already arrived. ―Act as 
though I am, and I will be,‖ says the proverb. 
11. As you read your affirmations, mentally visualize them as already achieved. 
Visualization refers to making mental pictures or movies; it‘s thinking without words. The brain 
thinks in pictures. If I ask you to think about your car, you probably don‘t see the letters C-A-R spelled 
out in your mind. Instead, you instantly get a picture of your car in your mind. Because your brain 
thinks in images, adding a big, bright, focused mental movie or picture of what you want will help you 
program your subconscious mind faster and more deeply than if you simply read your goals. 
In Psycho-Cybernetics, Dr. Maltz writes, ―Experimental and clinical psychologists have proven 
beyond a shadow of a doubt that the human nervous system cannot tell the difference between an 
actual experience and one imagined vividly and in detail.‖ As with affirmations, visualization is most 
effective when your body is in a relaxed (alpha brainwave) state, because that‘s when your 
subconscious mind is accessed most easily. 
In his book Peak Performance: Mental Training Techniques of the World’s Greatest Athletes, Dr. 
Charles A. Garfield writes, ―Without a doubt, the most dramatic contribution to the advancement of 
goal-setting skills in recent years has been the Soviets‘ introduction of visualization. During mental 
rehearsal, athletes create mental images of the exact movements they want to emulate in their sport. 
Use of this skill substantially increases the effectiveness of goal setting, which up until then had been 
little more than a dull listing procedure.‖ 
Garfield goes on to talk about a startling experiment conducted by Soviet sports scientists. The 
study examined the effect of mental training, including visualization, on four groups of world-class 
athletes just prior to the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics. The groups were divided as follows: 
Group 1: 100% physical training 
Group 2: 75% physical training, 25% mental training 

================================================================================
Group 3: 50% physical training, 50% mental training 
Group 4: 25% physical training, 75% mental training 
The researchers found that Group 4, the group with the most mental training, showed significantly 
greater improvement than Group 3. Group 3 showed more improvement than Group 2, and Group 2 
showed more improvement than Group 1! 
Dr. Maltz shared a similar account of an experiment about the effects of mental practice on 
improving basketball free throws. The study, published in Research Quarterly divided the subjects 
into three groups. Each group was tested for free-throw accuracy once at the beginning of the 
experiment and again at its conclusion. 
Group 1 physically practiced free throws for 20 days. Group 2 performed no practice at all. Group 3 
spent 20 minutes a day getting into a deeply relaxed state and visualizing themselves shooting free 
throws. When they missed, they would visualize themselves correcting their aim accordingly. 
The results were remarkable: The first group, which practiced 20 minutes a day, improved in 
scoring 24 percent. The second group, which had no practice, showed no improvement. The third 
group, which practiced only in their minds, improved their scoring 23 percent! Amazingly, mental 
practice produced results almost identical to physical practice. 
What does this research on athletes have to do with losing body fat? Everything! Remember that the 
subconscious is the part of the mind responsible for automatic behavior (also known as habits). To 
lose body fat, there are daily positive-action habits you must develop. By visualizing your fat loss or 
fitness goal as already achieved, you are giving your subconscious mind instructions that will cause 
you to act in a way consistent with reaching your goal. You‘ll go into automatic pilot mode. There will 
be less struggle and willpower involved. 
When you‘re in a situation that used to tempt you, you‘ll suddenly notice you‘re no longer tempted. 
If you used to dread going to the gym, you‘ll start looking forward to it. If the idea of eating healthy, 
natural foods used to seem unpleasant, you‘ll actually begin to enjoy it. If you used to crave certain 
junk foods, the cravings will mysteriously disappear. Everything will seem to get easier and your 
workouts will become better than ever. The end result of making ―mental motion pictures‖ is that you 
will get results more quickly than ever before. 
All great athletes and peak performers use visualization. Jack Nicklaus said he never hit a golf shot, 
not even in practice, without first having a very sharp, in-focus picture of it in his head. 
Tennis superstar Andre Agassi once told an interviewer that he‘d won Wimbledon at least ten 
thousand times. When asked what he meant, Agassi replied, ―Since I was five years old I saw it over 
and over and over again in my mind. When I walked on the court that day, it was my exact vision. I 
felt like I was stepping into the role I was made for, and I just demolished them!‖ 
Bodybuilders and fitness athletes use visualization in many ways: They often see pictures of their 
bodies the way they want them to look once they‘ve reached their ultimate goal. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger visualized his biceps as mountains: ―When I am doing barbell curls, I am visualizing 
my biceps as mountains—not just big, but huge!‖ 
As he was dieting down for competition, former pro bodybuilder Lee Labrada visualized the skin on 
his abs getting tighter and thinner, like cellophane wrap clinging to the abdominal muscles. 
Three-time Mr. Olympia Frank Zane said that he mentally saw himself winning the Mr. Olympia at 
least one million times before it actually happened. Former Miss Olympia Rachel McLish said, ―I 
visualize the blood surging through my muscles with every repetition and every set I do. When I pose, 
I‘ve got a mental picture of how I want to look. When you have that in your brain, the physical body 
just seems to respond.‖ 
Another way you can use creative visualization is to picture yourself taking the daily action steps 
necessary to achieve you goal. See yourself getting up early in the morning, preparing healthy meals 

================================================================================
in advance for the whole day, choosing healthy foods in restaurants, and confidently saying no to 
temptations. 
You can also use visualization to mentally rehearse your workouts, seeing yourself training with 
killer intensity, breaking new records in the gym, performing exercises with perfect technique, and 
enthusiastically doing your cardio while the fat melts away. 
Your visualization sessions could be as brief as five to ten minutes, or you can spend more time if 
you wish, but make it a scheduled daily discipline, preferably twice a day. You can use visualization 
any time, even between sets in the gym, but two of the best times are early in the morning and at night 
before you go to sleep. When you fall asleep thinking about your goals as already achieved, your 
subconscious continues to work on how to achieve them while you‘re sleeping, and then adjusts your 
actions during the next day to move you closer to your goals. 
What if you‘re not good at visualizing? What if you can‘t see vivid ―Technicolor pictures‖ in your 
mind? Don‘t worry about it: Everyone creates mental images in their own unique way. Some people 
see clear, vivid pictures, while others get only impressions. You‘ll get results either way and you‘ll get 
better with practice. It also helps to have a well-written and detailed description of your goal because 
words can automatically make pictures pop up into your mind. 
Another great technique to improve your ability to visualize your perfect body is to flip through 
fitness magazines and cut out pictures of people with the body you‘d like to have. Look at these 
pictures daily as you read your affirmations and visualize yourself with the same body. 
To take it a step further, cut out a picture of your head and paste it onto the picture of someone else 
who has the body you want. If you know how to use photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop, 
you could have a lot of fun with these ―visualization photos.‖ It might sound silly, but it‘s a 
remarkably effective technique for reprogramming your self-image. 
SOME REAL GOALS AND AFFIRMATIONS 
I‘ve given you a lot to think about, so to help jump-start your imagination, here are some ideas for 
how to write your goals and affirmations list. What follows is a composite list of some real goals from 
real people—both men and women—who successfully completed my personal coaching programs. 
Use their words to generate some ideas for a list of your own. 
WOMEN 
I am so happy and thankful now that I have 13 percent body fat! 
I am losing body fat and reaching my goal weight of 110 pounds and my goal body fat of 14 
percent by June 1st. 
I am fitting into my Gap jeans, size 4, by early November and looking so good in them when 
I wear them to work that I leave all the guys’ jaws on the floor. 
I am becoming a fitness magazine success story. When my success story is published, one of 
the star fitness photographers calls me for a photo shoot and includes me in the next 
swimsuit edition. 
I eat natural, unprocessed foods, the way they appear in nature, as often as I possibly can. 
I fit perfectly into the slinky black suit I bought this summer, and I am wearing it to work. 
My spaghetti-strap flowered summer dress from last summer fits me perfectly and I am 
wearing it during my winter vacation in the Caribbean. 

================================================================================
I am learning enough about my body, nutrition, and exercise that I am easily staying within 
2 to 3 pounds of my optimal weight for the rest of my life. 
I am celebrating the New Year with clearly visible abs. 
I wake up every morning at 6:00 to fit in my first meal and cardio before 7:00—yes, I am a 
morning person! 
I eat five small, but satisfying meals a day with proper ratios of lean protein, natural carbs, 
and healthy fats, always on time at three- to four-hour intervals. 
I stay well hydrated and purify my body by drinking a gallon of water every day. 
I constantly improve my body and optimize my genetic potential. 
I’m grateful and proud of how good I look today. 
I deserve to be healthy and super-fit. 
I help those close to me choose healthier habits by leading through example and being a 
reliable source of health and nutrition information. 
I am developing clean eating and consistent exercise habits that are so ingrained into my 
lifestyle that they stay with me for the rest of my life. 
MEN 
I am so happy and thankful now that my body fat is in the single digits. I now have 9 
percent body fat and I look great! 
I am reaching the most aggressive weight and body fat goal possible by the program’s end 
(217 pounds and 19.3 percent respectively) on January 1st. 
I can see all of my toes when I look down. 
By January 1st, I fit comfortably into size 32-inch pants without having to inhale. 
I am surprising (and shocking) my friends and family whom I haven’t seen in a while by the 
way I look at Christmas. 
I am keeping up these lifestyle changes when the program is over. 
I am reaching my ideal weight and body fat composition by April so I can show off my new 
body in the summertime. 
I carry my goal card with me at all times and read it as often as possible (at least three 
times a day). 
I am reaching my goal of 15 percent body fat and 199 pounds by December 31st. I know 
this is a little fast but it is my dream for New Year’s Eve—I can do it! 
By my 35th birthday on June 15th, I am so happy that I have lost 24 pounds of fat and my 
body fat has dropped by 6 percent! I look awesome, I feel great, and I’m ready for some 
summer fun. 
I am buying all new clothes to show off my new, lean body: killer suits, nice shoes, nice 
casual stuff. 
I look so good by Christmastime that my wife can’t stop touching and holding me. 
I am now leaner than I was 30 minutes ago (after finishing every cardio workout). 
Heads are turning when I take my shirt off. 
I look good with my shirt off. 

================================================================================
I am taking on being a bodybuilder and learning about bodybuilding (for tone and 
definition). 
I am continuing the program for another three months and burning another 24 pounds of 
fat. 
I design my weekends and vacations to include healthy activities. 
I eat five moderately sized meals every day, each with a serving of lean protein and a 
complex, all-natural carbohydrate, and I prepare my food in advance every morning. 
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO EVERY TIME YOU REACH A GOAL 
Every time you achieve a major goal you should do three things: 
1.  Celebrate or reward yourself. Great managers, great parents, and great animal trainers all have 
one thing in common: They know how to continually get their ―people‖ (employees, children, or 
animals) to repeat the behaviors they desire. They do it by rewarding the behaviors they want 
repeated. You should do the same thing: reinforce your success by rewarding yourself. Did you 
have a great week of nutrition and training? If so, go out and splurge! Have a ―free meal.‖ Eat 
some pizza. Treat yourself. If food as a reward doesn‘t work well for you, then pamper yourself 
some other way. Take a vacation. Get a massage. Go shopping. Buy yourself something you‘ve 
always wanted. New clothes are a great reward (you may be needing smaller sizes soon 
anyway!). And don‘t feel guilty when you really deserve it! 
2.  Keep a list of your achieved goals. It‘s been said that success breeds more success. That‘s why 
you should start a collection of all your successes. You will reach many small goals on your way 
to your ultimate goal. Write all of them down on an achieved-goal list. Any time you feel your 
motivation or enthusiasm flagging, go back and read your list of past successes. This is a 
surefire way to lift your spirits when you‘re feeling discouraged. Even after a few short months, 
you‘ll amaze yourself at how big your list becomes and how easily you can get motivated by 
reflecting on your past successes. 
3.  Set new goals continually. Goal setting never stops; it‘s an ongoing process, not an event. In 
truth, there‘s never an ―ultimate‖ goal, because if there were, and you reached it, what then? 
When the day arrives that you no longer have goals, your life ceases to have meaning. In his 
book Unleash the Power Within, Anthony Robbins writes: ―The only true security in life comes 
from knowing that every single day you are improving yourself in some way—that you are 
increasing the caliber of who you are. I don‘t ever worry about maintaining the quality of my 
life, because every day I work on improving it.‖ 
WHY YOU SHOULD PUT THIS BOOK DOWN AND SET YOUR 
GOALS RIGHT NOW 
To conclude this chapter, I‘d like to tell you why you should put this book down this very minute and 
write out your goals—now! 
Years ago, I read a book by peak performance coach Anthony Robbins called Unlimited Power: 
The New Science of Personal Achievement. I was so impressed that I purchased Robbins‘s tape series 
called Personal Power. In those tapes, Robbins discusses the importance of setting goals. 

================================================================================
As I listened to the audio on goal setting, Robbins urged me, ―Stop the tape now and do the goal-
setting exercise.‖ There was a brief pause and then Tony came back on and repeated his instructions. 
He said in a teasing voice, ―If you just kept listening and you didn‘t stop the tape and write down your 
goals, stop the tape and do it now.‖ Guess what I did? I just kept listening. I said to myself, ―I know 
what my goals are; I don‘t need to do any corny goal-setting exercise,‖ so I just kept listening to the 
rest of the tape. (Dumb, dumb, dumb!) 
Eight years later I had achieved some moderate success in several areas of my life, including 
bodybuilding, but I was frustrated because I hadn‘t reached my biggest, most important goals and I 
couldn‘t figure out why. Then I thought about the Tony Robbins tape. I remembered that even though 
I definitely knew what I wanted, I never took the time to write it down and read it every day. 
Frustrated with my mediocre results, I conceded and went back to the goal-setting exercise I blew 
off eight years earlier. Sure enough, within 12 months I had won two overall bodybuilding titles and 
within a few short years after committing my goals to writing and reading my goal list every day, I 
had accomplished every single one of them! It was amazing—almost spooky! Then I made a new list, 
with bigger, better goals that I am still working on to this day—and I know I will achieve them too. 
Put this book down right now, make your goal list, and write out your three-month goal on a small 
card to carry with you. Don‘t worry if it‘s not perfect, just start writing. You can always go back to it 
later and edit. Do it now! 
EAT: 
NUTRITION (The 2
nd element) 
Each of the four elements in Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle are important, and each enhances the others, but nutrition is the 
foundation for everything. What you eat is the make-you-or-break-you factor. Get nutrition wrong and it can sabotage your results 
completely. Get it right and the rest is easy. 
Nutrition is so vital it deserves extra attention. That‘s why I gave more space to nutrition in this book than any other topic. The 
detailed information in these eight chapters is what makes people call this book their nutrition bible. It‘s also what will make this 
book a reference guide for you for the rest of your life. Whenever you have a diet, food, or nutrition question, pull this book off 
your shelf and you‘ll find the answer here. 
These chapters contain just enough nutrition science so you understand the rationale behind the plan, but on every page, the 
technical is turned into the practical. There are guidelines, rules, and action steps you can put to use immediately. Now dive in and 
start seeing your body get leaner, stronger, healthier, and fitter—fast.

CHAPTER 7 
Understanding Calories 
Any discussion about optimal calorie intake is really a total waste of time—unless you are actually 
counting the calories! Unless you have done this in writing, and over a significant period of time (4–12 
weeks), any discussion of this nature is purely academic. Don’t kid yourself—get out your diary, buy 
a calorie/nutrient counter book and do yourself a favor; get to really know what you are doing—and 
more importantly—what the result of this specific combination is. 
—Ian King, Australian strength coach and author of Get Buffed! Ian King’s Guide to Getting 
Bigger, Stronger and Leaner 
CALORIES COUNT 
People talk about calories all the time, but if you ask the average guy on the street to explain exactly 
what a calorie is or tell you how many calories he eats and how many he burns every day, he wouldn‘t 
have a clue. What‘s more shocking is if you ask the average dieter, she wouldn‘t know either. 
By the time you finish this chapter, you‘ll be an expert on calories. You‘ll know exactly what 
calories are, how they‘re stored in your body, how many you burn every day, and how many you 
should eat for your body size and activity level to burn fat without losing muscle. I‘ll also show you 
why not keeping track of calories might be the only thing preventing you from getting leaner. Best of 
all, I‘ll show you a simple method you can use to make calculating and tracking calories a quick and 
easy process. 
THE DEFINITION OF A CALORIE 
A food calorie (kilocalorie) is the amount of heat required to raise 1 kilogram (1 liter) of water 1 
degree Celsius. A calorie, then, is simply a measure of heat energy. Like any fuel (gasoline, coal, 
wood, etc.), food releases energy when it‘s burned. The more calories that are in a food, the more 
energy will be released. 
The word ―calorie‖ is used to describe the amount of energy in food as well as the amount of energy 
stored in your body as adipose (fat) and glycogen (carbohydrate). For example, a glazed doughnut will 
deposit 210 calories into your body and it would take a 25-minute brisk walk on the treadmill to burn 
off those calories from your body‘s energy stores. 
CALORIES, BODY FAT, AND SURVIVAL 
Body fat is like a reserve storage tank for energy. When we talk about ―burning body fat,‖ we‘re 
talking about releasing calories from your storage tank and using them to fuel your activities. If you‘re 
inactive, your body fat just sits there in storage until you need it. If you‘re an average 185-pound man 
with about 18 percent body fat, or a 135-pound woman with 25 percent body fat, you have about 33 

================================================================================
pounds of adipose tissue. There are 3,500 calories in each pound of fat, which adds up to a grand total 
of 115,550 calories in fat storage. That‘s enough fuel to last you a long time! 
From a survival point of view, body fat is a good thing and being too lean is a liability. But only 
small amounts of body fat are essential for health. In modern society, where famine is no longer the 
concern it was for our ancestors, excess body fat is little more than an annoying cosmetic problem. 
High body fat is also a health risk. 
The good news is, by understanding calories and learning how to balance your energy input with 
your output, you can easily burn as much fat as you want and maintain a healthy and attractive body 
for life. 
The Calorie Bank Analogy 
An easy way to understand the calorie concept is to think of your body as a living calorie bank and 
caloric energy as money. You can make energy (fat) deposits and withdrawals from your body the 
way you would make money deposits and withdrawals from the bank, depending on how high your 
energy costs are. 
When your energy costs are equal to the calories you consume, no deposit or withdrawal of calories 
takes place; your balance stays the same. When your energy costs are greater than the number of 
calories you ingest, you make an energy withdrawal from your calorie bank and your body fat balance 
decreases. When your energy costs are less than the amount of calories you take in, you make an 
energy deposit and your body fat balance increases. 
The exception to this rule is when you‘re on a weight training program. In this case, a small calorie 
surplus can be partitioned into muscle tissue. But even when you‘re training hard, if the calorie surplus 
is too large, the excess beyond what‘s needed for muscle development is deposited into fat storage. 
The Law of Energy Balance 
This brings us to the law of energy balance: the granddaddy of all nutritional laws, and the first 
nutrition fundamental you must understand and obey if you want to get super lean. The law of energy 
balance says that if you burn more calories than you consume, your body must withdraw stored fuel 
for energy to make up for the deficit and you will lose weight. The reverse is also true: If you consume 
more calories than you burn each day, you will deposit the surplus into fat storage and gain weight. 
The Law of Energy Balance 
To lose weight, you must burn more calories than you consume each day. 
To gain weight, you must consume more calories than you burn each day. 
THE FIRST COROLLARY TO THE LAW OF ENERGY BALANCE 
There are two corollaries to the law of energy balance. The first one says that too much of anything—
even healthy foods—will get stored as body fat. 
Calories count! The laws of thermodynamics govern energy balance in humans just as they do in 
other systems. In the face of this unbreakable law, many diet programs insist that calories don‘t 
matter. They claim that as long as you eat certain foods, you can eat as much as you want and you‘ll 
still lose weight. 

================================================================================
For example, some foods are healthier than others because they are nutrient dense and unrefined. 
But eating for health and eating for weight loss are different goals. Regardless of how healthy the 
foods are, if you eat more calories than you burn, you‘ll still gain weight, usually in the form of fat. 
Some diets claim that if you cut carbs, you can eat an unlimited amount of everything else (protein 
and fat). Not true. Even if you ate zero carbs, if you ate more calories from protein and fat than you 
burned in a day, you would still gain body fat. Low-carb, high-protein diets reduce hunger and make it 
harder to overeat. The end result is that most people automatically eat fewer calories. 
Many people believe that eating exorbitant amounts of protein will make them gain more muscle, 
but even excess protein calories can be turned into fat. There‘s no such thing as a diet where you can 
eat all you want and lose weight simply by eating (or avoiding) one particular food or food group. 
THE SECOND COROLLARY TO THE LAW OF ENERGY BALANCE 
The second corollary to the law of energy balance says that if you eat fewer calories than you burn 
each day (i.e., you‘re in a calorie deficit), even if you eat unhealthy (―junk‖) food, you won‘t store it 
as body fat. 
Corollary two is not a free license to eat whatever you want. You might be able to get away with 
eating a low-calorie junk food diet without gaining weight, but if you want to stay healthy, calorie 
quality is important. When you understand this corollary, it simply takes pressure off you. It lets you 
relax and enjoy your favorite indulgences from time to time without feeling guilty, as long as you 
maintain your calorie deficit. You can have your cake and eat it, too—you just can‘t eat the whole 
thing! 
THE IMPORTANCE OF PORTION CONTROL 
The law of energy balance and its two corollaries override all other weight-loss laws. Many people 
work out diligently, choose healthy foods, and do everything else right, but they miss the most 
obvious factor of all: They‘re simply eating too much. Sometimes the only mistake preventing you 
from reaching your fat-loss goals is ignoring portion sizes. 
Getting leaner requires the discipline and willpower to control your calories at all times, even when 
you eat your occasional cheat meals. Always pay attention to portion sizes. Notice how full your 
stomach feels and never stuff yourself. Lose the idea that you must clear your plate, especially at 
restaurants or when you‘re served by others. Instead, stop eating when you‘re only 80 percent full. 
Even better, know your exact calorie needs and stop when you‘ve reached your predetermined limit 
for each meal. 
HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR TOTAL DAILY ENERGY 
EXPENDITURE (TDEE) 
The first step in designing your personal fat-burning plan is to calculate how many calories you need 
every day. This number is called your total daily energy expenditure, or TDEE. It‘s also known as 
your maintenance level, because this is the point where your calorie deposits are equal to your calorie 
withdrawals. TDEE is the total number of calories your body burns in 24 hours, including basal 
metabolic rate and all activities. 
Before we do that, let‘s look at the six factors that TDEE depends on. All calorie formulas are 
estimates, but the more of these factors you account for, the more accurate and customized your 
estimation will be. 

================================================================================
Six Factors That Influence Your Daily Calorie Needs 
1. BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR) 
As you learned in Chapter 3, BMR is the total number of calories you burn every day for basic bodily 
functions. This includes digestion, circulation, respiration, temperature regulation, cell construction, 
and every other biological process in your body. In other words, BMR is the sum of all the energy you 
use, not including physical activity. BMR usually accounts for the largest part of your total daily 
calorie expenditure—about two-thirds. 
2. ACTIVITY LEVEL 
Next to BMR, your activity level is the second most important factor in how many calories you need 
every day. The more active you are, the more calories you burn. If you sit behind a desk all day and 
relax on your couch all night, you don‘t burn much. 
3. WEIGHT 
Your total body weight and total body size are also major factors in the number of calories you need. 
The bigger you are, the more calories you require to sustain and move your body. This is a very 
important part of customizing the plan for your body. Small-framed people cannot eat as much as 
larger-framed people. Short and petite women make this mistake the most: If they eat like men or 
larger women, they won‘t lose and may actually gain weight. 
4. LEAN BODY MASS (LBM) 
Separating your total weight into its lean and fat components helps you calculate your calorie needs 
more accurately. The higher your LBM, the higher your BMR. Muscle is metabolically active tissue 
that requires a lot of energy to build and sustain. This means that the more muscle you have, the more 
calories you‘ll burn at rest. 
5. AGE 
Metabolic rate tends to slow with age. Therefore, the number of calories the average person requires 
also decreases with age. This explains why people who don‘t exercise but continue to eat the same 
amount of food as they did when they were younger find their body fat creeps up after age 35 or 40. 
Fortunately, you can prevent and even reverse metabolic slowdown, fat gain, and age-related muscle 
loss with weight training and proper nutrition. 
6. GENDER 
Men usually require more calories than women. The difference is not entirely due to gender but to 
body size. The average man is larger and carries more muscle mass than the average female. If not for 
these genetically inherited variations in BMR, a 150-pound man and a 150-pound woman have 
approximately the same calorie requirements if their activity level and lean body mass are the same. 
The Fast Way to Estimate Your Calorie Requirements 
According to exercise physiologists William McArdle and Frank Katch, the average maintenance 
level is 2,000 to 2,200 calories per day for women and 2,700 to 2,900 calories for men. Actual calorie 
expenditures can vary widely and are much higher for extremely active people. Some triathletes and 
ultra-endurance athletes need as many as 5,000 to 6,000 calories per day just to maintain their weight. 

================================================================================
Endurance cyclists often slog down energy bars, gels, and high-calorie carbohydrate drinks on the 
saddle, just to keep from losing weight by the hour! 
It‘s always best to crunch the numbers and customize your nutrition plan as much as possible, but if 
you‘re average in body size and activity level and you don‘t like math, this is the fastest way to 
estimate your calorie requirements: Use these average ranges as your starting point. 
QUICK START 
FOR MAINTAINING WEIGHT (TDEE): 
Men (average): 
2,700–2,900 calories 
Women (average): 
2,000–2,200 calories 
FOR LOSING WEIGHT (DEFICIT): 
Men (average): 
2,100–2,500 calories 
Women (average): 
1,400–1,800 calories 
FOR GAINING WEIGHT (SURPLUS): 
Men (average): 
3,200–3,800+ calories 
Women (average): 
2,300–2,600+ calories 
Three formulas to calculate your customized calorie needs 
Exercise physiologists have developed formulas to help you calculate your daily calorie needs. I‘ve 
included three different equations you can choose from that have been real-world tested and proven to 
provide accurate estimates. 
• the quick method (use this one for a quick estimate with the least number crunching) 
• the Harris-Benedict equation (use this one if you don‘t know your lean body mass) 
• the Katch-McArdle equation (use this one if you know your lean body mass) 
1. THE QUICK METHOD 
A fast and easy way to see how many calories you need daily is to use your total current body weight 
in pounds times a multiplier between 11 and 20. 
Fat loss = 11–13 calories per pound of body weight 
Maintenance = 14–16 calories per pound of body weight 
Weight gain = 18–20+ calories per pound of body weight 
The quick method is popular, but it doesn‘t account for body composition or activity level, so if 
you‘re extremely active, this may underestimate your calorie needs. If you‘re an older adult or if your 
body weight is much higher than average, this may overestimate your calorie needs. 

================================================================================
Despite these limitations, this simple formula is an excellent way for most people to get a quick 
ballpark estimate, as long as your activity level is average and your body fat is average or better. 
2. THE HARRIS-BENEDICT EQUATION 
The Harris-Benedict equation uses height, weight, age, and gender to determine basal metabolic rate 
(BMR), making it more accurate than calculating calorie needs on body weight alone. The only 
variable it doesn‘t consider is LBM. This equation is very accurate for all but the extremely muscular 
and extremely obese, where it may overestimate caloric needs. 
Men: BMR = 66 + (13.7 × weight in kilograms) + (5 × height in centimeters) − (6.8 × age in 
years) 
Women: BMR = 655 + (9.6 × weight in kilograms) + (1.8 × height in centimeters) − (4.7 × age 
in years) 
Conversions: 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters 
1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds 
Example: 
You are male. 
You are 30 years old. 
You are 5 feet 8 inches tall (172.7 centimeters). 
You weigh 172 pounds (78 kilograms). 
Your BMR = 66 + 1068 + 863.6 − 204 = 1,793 calories/day. 
Once you know your BMR, you can calculate TDEE by multiplying your BMR by an activity 
factor. Use the following chart to estimate your activity level. If in doubt, guess on the low side, 
because most people overestimate how many calories they burn each day. 
Activity Level 
Multiplier 
Description 
Sedentary 
BMR × 1.2 
Little or no exercise, desk job 
Lightly active 
BMR × 1.375 
Light exercise or sports 3–5 days/week 
Moderately active 
BMR × 1.55 
Moderate exercise or sports 3–5 days/week 
Very active 
BMR × 1.725 
Hard exercise or sports 6–7 days/week 
Extremely active 
BMR × 1.9 
Hard daily exercise or sports and physical labor job or twice-a-day training (football camp, etc.) 

================================================================================
Continuing with the previous example: 
Your BMR is 1,793 calories per day. 
Your activity level is moderately active (you work out three to five times a week). 
Your activity factor is 1.55. 
Your TDEE = 1.55 × 1,793 = 2,779 calories/day. 
3. THE KATCH-MCARDLE EQUATION 
Because the Katch-McArdle equation accounts for LBM, it applies equally to both men and women 
and it‘s the most accurate method for calculating your daily calorie needs. 
BMR (men and women) = 370 + (21.6 × lean mass in kilograms) 
Example: 
You weigh 172 pounds (78 kilograms). 
Your body fat percentage is 14 percent (24.1 pounds fat, 147.9 pounds lean). 
Your lean mass is 147.9 pounds (67.2 kilograms). 
Your BMR = 370 + (21.6 × 67.2) = 1,821 calories. 
To determine TDEE from BMR, you simply multiply BMR by the activity factor, as shown in the 
following example: 
Continuing with the previous example: 
Your BMR is 1,821. 
Your activity level is moderately active (moderate workouts three to four times a week). 
Your activity factor is 1.55. 
Your TDEE = 1.55 × 1821 = 2,822 calories. 
The difference in TDEE as determined by both formulas is statistically insignificant (2,779 versus 
2,822 calories), because the person we used as an example is average in body size and body 
composition. The primary benefit of including LBM in the equation is increased accuracy when your 
body composition leans to either end of the spectrum (very muscular or very obese). 
THE MATHEMATICS OF WEIGHT CONTROL: THREE 
GUIDELINES FOR ADJUSTING YOUR CALORIES 
Once you know your TDEE (maintenance level), the next step is to adjust your calories according to 
your primary goal. The mathematics of weight control are simple: 
1.  To keep your weight the same: Stay at your daily caloric maintenance level. 
2.  To lose weight: Create a calorie deficit by reducing your calories below your maintenance level 
(or keep your calories the same and create a deficit by increasing your activity). 

================================================================================
3.  To gain weight: Create a calorie surplus by increasing your calories above your maintenance 
level. To gain weight as lean body mass, a program of progressive resistance weight training is 
mandatory. 
HOW TO ADJUST YOUR CALORIES FOR FAT LOSS 
Releasing stored energy from your fat cells is a complex neuroendocrine process, but it starts with one 
simple condition: You create a calorie deficit by burning more than you consume. There are 3,500 
calories in a pound of stored body fat. In theory, if you create a 3,500-calorie deficit per week through 
diet, exercise, or a combination of both, you will lose one pound (assuming you lose 100 percent body 
fat). If you create a 7,000-calorie deficit in a week, you will lose two pounds. 
You can create the calorie deficit by reducing food, increasing exercise, or preferably a combination 
of both. 
Example: 
Your weight is 172 pounds (78.18 kilograms). 
Your TDEE is 2,822 calories. 
Your daily calorie deficit to lose fat is 500 calories. 
Your daily caloric intake for a one-pound weekly weight loss is 2,822 − 500 = 2,322 calories. 
Your daily caloric intake for a two-pound weekly fat loss is 2,822 – 1,000 = 1,822 calories. 
The ―minus 500 to 1,000 method‖ shows you how much you would need to eat to lose one or two 
pounds per week. Depending on the individual, a 1,000-calorie deficit could be a perfectly reasonable 
reduction or it could be semistarvation. 
For example, if you‘re a large and active male with a 3,400-calorie maintenance level, a 1,000-
calorie deficit means a daily caloric intake of 2,400 calories per day. That‘s a 30 percent deficit, which 
is aggressive but well within reason. If you‘re a petite, inactive female with a maintenance level of 
1,900 calories per day, then a 1,000-calorie deficit means a daily intake of only 900 calories. That‘s a 
53 percent deficit, which is semistarvation and potentially unhealthy. As Einstein would say, that‘s 
relativity. 
BURN THE FAT, FEED THE MUSCLE CALORIE DEFICIT 
GUIDELINES 
The ideal way to choose your calorie deficit is to use a sliding scale and to select a percentage deficit 
relative to your maintenance level. For healthy, long-term fat loss, choose a deficit between 15 percent 
and 30 percent below your maintenance level. 
Conservative deficit 
15%–20% below maintenance 
Moderate deficit 
21%–25% below maintenance 

================================================================================
Aggressive deficit 
26%–30% below maintenance 
Extremely aggressive deficit 
31%–40% below maintenance 
Semistarvation 
50% below maintenance 
Example (conservative deficit): 
Your TDEE is 2,822 calories. 
Your calorie deficit is 20 percent (0.20 × 2,822 = 564 calories). 
Your optimal caloric intake for fat loss = 2,258 calories. 
Projected weight loss = 1.1 pounds per week 
Example (aggressive deficit): 
Your TDEE is 2,822 calories. 
Your calorie deficit is 30 percent (0.30 × 2,822 = 847 calories). 
Your optimal caloric intake for fat loss = 1,975 calories. 
Projected weight loss = 1.7 pounds per week 
Your calorie deficit—how much you‘ll decrease your calories below maintenance—is one of the 
first places you‘ll customize your plan. When deciding whether to be aggressive or conservative with 
your deficit, you should consider not only your desired rate of fat loss (which may be influenced by 
whether you‘re under deadline to achieve a goal), but also your starting body fat level. 
In an aggressive deficit, lean people tend to lose more lean tissue and retain more fat, while obese 
people tend to lose more body fat and retain more lean tissue. This explains why obese people can 
tolerate low-calorie diets better than lean people. If you have plenty of energy in storage as body fat, 
then you‘re in less danger of starvation than a very lean person. 
People who are already lean but want to get even leaner (a.k.a. ―ripped‖) have a higher risk of 
losing lean tissue with very aggressive calorie cuts, especially when training volume and intensity are 
high. That‘s why, if you‘re lean, it‘s wise to keep your calorie deficit moderate or conservative. If 
you‘re overweight, it‘s safer to make your calorie deficit more aggressive. 
QUICK START 
Want to quickly and easily figure out your ideal personal calorie intake, including your basal 
metabolic rate (BMR), your maintenance level (TDEE), and your optimal daily intake for fat 
loss? Or, do you want to skip the math altogether and see the calorie shortcuts? Simply jump to 
the appendix at any time and use the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle calorie customization 
worksheet. 

================================================================================
CALORIE DEFICIT THRESHOLDS: HOW LOW IS TOO LOW? 
A larger calorie deficit results in faster weight loss. But a deficit that‘s too large or too prolonged will 
eventually slow your metabolism, increase hunger, decrease energy, reduce essential nutrient intake, 
and cause a loss of lean body mass. That leaves you with a dilemma: How low should you go to get 
maximum fat loss with minimum side effects? 
There‘s a threshold where cutting calories more triggers metabolic, health, or compliance problems 
at an accelerated rate. The American College of Sports Medicine‘s suggestions of reasonable calorie 
minimums are 1,200 per day for women and 1,800 per day for men. But as with all fixed 
recommendations, these are generalizations. It‘s always ideal to customize. 
The best practice is to follow the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle guidelines and use a maximum 
calorie deficit of 30 percent below maintenance. There are some situations where a larger deficit 
makes sense, but it may be riskier. Extremely aggressive deficits should not be used except by very 
overweight or obese patients under their doctor‘s orders. 
WHAT IF YOU WANT TO GAIN MUSCLE? 
The initial focus of Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is burning fat off as quickly and efficiently as 
possible. Many people use this program to get lean, and once they achieve the low level of body fat 
they want, they change their goal to gaining lean muscle. When that time comes, the principles of this 
program will still apply; you‘ll simply need to eat more so you‘re in a calorie surplus most of the time. 
As long as you still train hard, bring up the calories slowly, and keep the surplus small, you won‘t 
have to worry about gaining back any fat. 
If you have a maintenance level of 2,800 calories, then your optimal intake for fat loss would be 
about 2,250 calories a day—a 20 percent deficit. If your primary goal is gaining muscle, then your 
optimal intake would be at least 3,220 calories per day—a 15 percent surplus. That‘s a 1,000-calorie 
difference between a fat-loss plan and a muscle-gaining plan. You have to eat a lot more to gain lean 
muscle at the maximum rate. 
Some people are tempted to try losing fat and gaining muscle at the same time. Advertisements in 
the fitness magazines have convinced many people that huge gains of muscle along with large losses 
of body fat are common and easy to accomplish. But you can see from the previous example how fat-
loss and muscle-gain goals are on opposite ends of the calorie spectrum and why achieving both 
concurrently is a challenge. 
High body fat is unhealthy, so if you‘re carrying a lot of fat, focus your goals on shedding the fat 
first. Once the fat is off, you can shift gears into the lifelong maintenance phase where you gradually 
increase your calories to your TDEE and hold it there, or you establish new goals for gaining muscle, 
where you set calories in a surplus. 
HOW TO RECONCILE BETWEEN THEORETICAL (ON PAPER) 
AND ACTUAL (REAL-WORLD) CALORIE NEEDS 
The calorie equations in this chapter are surprisingly accurate, but keep in mind that they‘re all 
estimations, designed only to give you a starting point. Like all the advice in this book, the numbers 
on paper take a backseat to real-world feedback. The only way to tell if your estimate is correct is to 
get started, establish a baseline, and track your weekly progress. If you don‘t get the results you 
expect, adjust your caloric intake and exercise levels and repeat the process until you do. 

================================================================================
To help you establish a baseline and fine-tune your calories quickly, it‘s also a smart idea to 
compare your calorie calculations on paper to the amount you‘ve been eating recently. Recall a typical 
day of eating and write down in a notebook, spreadsheet, or electronic journal everything you ate from 
the time you got up in the morning to the time you went to sleep at night. Don‘t forget the little things 
like sauces, condiments, mints, the milk in your coffee, the sports drink during your workout, that beer 
on the weekend, the late-night snacks, and the ―non-caloric‖ sweeteners (which actually do have 
calories!). If your food intake varies and you never have a typical day, then write down three days‘ 
worth of recent eating, so you can add them up and divide by three to get a daily average. 
Next, look up the caloric value of each food and write it down next to each food item. There‘s a 
handy calorie quick reference chart in the appendix of this book. You may want to consider also 
getting a good calorie counter app, online food database, or nutrient values book such as Corinne T. 
Netzer‘s Complete Book of Food Counts. Then add everything up so you can see how many calories 
you‘ve actually been eating. 
Once you‘ve established your baseline, continue to adjust your calories each week based on the 
real-world results. You won‘t need to recalculate your calories often. You‘ll usually go back to the 
formulas and recalculate after a period of months when you end a fat-loss phase and transition into a 
maintenance or muscle-gain program, or anytime you‘ve had a large change in activity level or body 
weight. 
ADJUST YOUR CALORIE INTAKE GRADUALLY IF NECESSARY 
It‘s sometimes inadvisable to make drastic changes to your calorie intake all at once. After you‘ve 
done your calculations on paper and you‘ve completed your typical day‘s food recall, compare the two 
numbers. If your actual caloric intake was hundreds of calories higher or lower than your new target 
amount according to the formulas, then you may need to adjust your calories slowly. 
Cutting calories quickly and abruptly often leads to diet failure and weight regain because the 
change is too dramatic to sustain. On the other hand, if you crunch your numbers and see that you‘ve 
been eating a lot less than you should, it‘s equally important to increase your calories gradually in case 
your metabolism is sluggish. A sudden jump in calories could cause you to gain weight at first. 
The best approach is to gradually adjust your calories in small weekly increments of 100–200 
calories at a time to allow your metabolism to acclimate. 
CALORIE COUNTING MADE EASY 
Some people argue that counting calories is too tedious or unrealistic for most people long term. 
Instead, they recommend counting portions, where you‘re paying attention to serving size, but you 
don‘t know the exact calorie amount. Tracking portion sizes is a start because this acknowledges the 
importance of energy in versus energy out. It also allows you to reduce portion size if you need to 
increase your deficit. The downside of counting portions is that you‘re only guessing at the calories. 
Although a lucky few can ―wing it‖ and guess at everything with good results, the people with the 
best bodies in the world are meticulous about tracking calories. They leave nothing to chance and 
neither should you. This is especially true at times when you‘re working hard to achieve a major goal 
with a deadline, whether it‘s a bodybuilding competition, a body transformation contest, or losing 6 
percent body fat for vacation. Tracking calories is also important if you hit a plateau. If you aren‘t 
quantifying and tracking your food intake, it‘s almost impossible to troubleshoot stalled fat loss. 

================================================================================
One way to make this quick and easy is to create your meal plan on a spreadsheet such as Microsoft 
Excel. Many apps and software programs are also available for creating meal plans or tracking food 
intake. MyFitnessPal is a free app that is popular with Burn the Fat readers because of its extensive 
food database. The Burn the Fat Meal Planner software is available with a subscription to our 
members-only website at www.BurnTheFatInnerCircle.com. 
Once you have your daily meal plan finished, print it, stick it on your refrigerator (or carry it in your 
daily planner or mobile device), and you have an eating goal for the day. If you don‘t want to crunch 
any numbers at all, you can use the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle sample meals and meal plans in 
Chapter 14 to get you started. 
All you need to get going on the road to a better body is one good meal plan, customized for your 
calorie needs. Eating the same thing every day makes establishing a baseline, tracking calories, 
sticking to the program, and troubleshooting plateaus super-easy. If you enjoy variety, you can create 
a few days or even an entire week of meal plans. Using an exchange system based on food groups 
makes substitutions a cinch. It is a good idea, though, to include a variety of foods within each day‘s 
plan. This way you can be sure you get the complete spectrum of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other 
nutrients you need for good health. 
During the initial stages, weigh and measure all your food. Get yourself a food scale, available in 
the kitchen section of most houseware or department stores, and a set of measuring cups and spoons. 
Make it a habit to read the nutrition facts panel on the labels of packaged foods to learn the 
ingredients, calories, and nutrient values. For produce and natural foods that don‘t come with labels 
(fruits, vegetables, legumes, yams, potatoes, and so on), it helps to keep a calorie book, chart, or 
electronic database handy. 
Keep up this level of tracking until you reach your goal or at least until you start to get a ―sixth 
sense‖ for portion sizes and calories. You can go back to weighing and measuring food anytime in the 
future if you hit a plateau. 
If you‘re not familiar with the calorie amounts in the foods you eat, and especially if you eat 
differently every day, I strongly recommend keeping a daily nutrition journal, either electronically or 
on paper, for at least 4 to 12 weeks. Keeping a food journal at least once in your life is an amazing 
learning experience that you‘ll never get from reading a book or following a premade meal plan. 
Creating your own meal plans requires a bit of effort at first, but if you think about it, when you use 
the Burn the Fat method, you only need to count calories once in the beginning when you create your 
meal plans. After that, you just follow the plan. Once you‘ve got a knack for calories from creating 
meal plans on paper, then you can eyeball portions and get a pretty good (and much more educated) 
ballpark figure. 
WHY MEAL PLANNING AND CALORIE TRACKING ARE 
DISCIPLINES THAT PAY 
It‘s not necessary to write down how many calories are in every crumb you eat for the rest of your life, 
but it is vital to understand and obey the law of calorie balance, get familiar with the calorie counts of 
foods you eat often, and at least know the ballpark figure of your current daily intake. There‘s no 
better way to learn about calories than to carefully count them in the early phases when you‘re just 
getting started, otherwise you‘ll always be guessing. 
Ultimately, how meticulously you track your food intake should depend on your results. If you‘re 
shedding fat while maintaining your lean body mass without counting anything, then keep doing what 
you‘re doing. But if you‘re not making the progress you want, a lack of nutritional precision might be 
what‘s holding you back. 

================================================================================
Some people don‘t consider nutritional number crunching fun or easy, but tracking your food intake 
is a discipline and becoming disciplined about your nutrition and training habits pays huge dividends: 
not only great health, higher energy, more muscle, and less fat, but also great results that are steady, 
predictable, and completely under your control. 
The best definition of ―discipline‖ I‘ve ever heard comes from achievement expert Brian Tracy, 
who said, ―Discipline is doing what is hard and necessary rather than what is fun and easy and doing it 
when it‘s necessary, whether you feel like doing it or not.‖ 
If you want the best results, then do what‘s necessary: Get out your calorie counter, your 
spreadsheet, or your nutrition software and create your meal plans. Then get out your measuring cups 
and food scale and start tracking what and how much you‘re eating. 
In the upcoming chapters, you‘ll learn about the other numbers that are most important to track—the 
macronutrients—so you can cut your body fat down to super-low levels, revealing the chiseled muscle 
definition you‘ve always wanted!

CHAPTER 8 
Balancing Your Macronutrients 
Each meal should be structured to include a lean protein, a starchy carbohydrate, and a fibrous 
carbohydrate. The protein and fiber in this combination of foods slows the digestion of the 
carbohydrates, consequently providing consistent energy levels, sustained endurance, and a constant 
supply of nutrients to your body for energy, growth, and repair. 
—John Parrillo, bodybuilding nutritionist 
IS A CALORIE JUST A CALORIE? 
A calorie deficit is a required condition for weight loss, but if creating a healthy fat-burning nutrition 
plan were only a matter of calories and nothing else, then three diets at the same calorie level—the 
first composed of 100 percent protein, the second 100 percent carbohydrates, and the third 100 percent 
fats—would all produce the same results. Common sense alone tells you that eating 2,000 calories of 
fish and vegetables (lean protein and fibrous carbohydrates) won‘t produce the same results as 2,000 
calories of potato chips and soda (processed fat and carbohydrates). 
How you divide your calories between the three macronutrients—proteins, carbohydrates, and 
fats—and which foods you choose from each category has a profound impact on your body and your 
health. Severely restricting any one of the macronutrients can lead to nutrient deficiencies and a drop 
in your physical performance. Your macronutrient choices can also affect your calorie intake. Some 
food groups have more calories per gram than others, so it‘s easy to overeat them. Other foods are 
extremely filling, so you tend to eat less. 
How you split up your macronutrients can even affect your hormones. This includes hormones of 
hunger and metabolism, which influence how many calories you eat or burn each day, as well as 
hormones that influence energy partitioning. Partitioning refers to where your body sends the calories 
and nutrients after they‘re metabolized—into fat or muscle—and what kind of body mass you lose or 
gain as a result. 
Start with calories, but don‘t stop there. There‘s more to good nutrition than calories. To achieve all 
your goals—not just weight loss but also fat loss, muscular growth, great health, and peak 
performance—it‘s important to get the calories right and get your protein, carbs, and fats right. 
Balancing these numbers is the foundation of every Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle meal plan. 
THE FIRST RULE OF MACRONUTRIENTS: EAT PROTEINS AND 
CARBS TOGETHER AT EACH MEAL 
Before we talk about specific numbers and percentages, let‘s start with the most fundamental rule of 
macronutrients: Your nutrition program should never consist primarily of one food type or one 
macronutrient; you need a proper balance between proteins, carbs, and fats. 
Without breaking out spreadsheets or crunching any numbers, you can get your macronutrient ratios 
in the ballpark simply by having a serving of lean protein and a serving of natural carbohydrate at 

================================================================================
every meal. If you eat a lot of meals with proteins or carbs by themselves, your ratios are more likely 
to be out of balance for the day. 
Many popular diets—such as an all-protein diet or an all-fruits-and-vegetables diet—fail to obey 
this rule because they overemphasize one macronutrient. Diet gurus often claim that there‘s magic in 
the special foods they emphasize. It‘s closer to the truth to say that restricting entire food groups is a 
clever way to make you eat less. Any weight lost through severe restriction is likely to return and 
comes at the expense of a potentially unhealthy diet that‘s missing major nutrients. Apart from 
considerations due to allergies, sensitivities, and intolerances, eliminating an entire food group is 
never a smart idea. 
Another diet fad, which became popular through several best-selling books, is called food 
combining. This would be more accurately described as food separating, because it argues that certain 
foods, such as meat and potatoes or protein and fruit, shouldn‘t be eaten together. Proponents claim 
that improper food combinations cause poor digestion, sap your energy, put stress on your immune 
system, and even promote disease. 
As you experiment with your food choices to customize your own meal plan, it‘s possible that some 
foods or combinations of foods might make you feel better or worse. However, there‘s no evidence 
that there are any benefits to separating carbs and protein. 
In the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle program, you combine lean proteins and natural carbs together 
with every meal. An example of a lean protein and starchy carb combination at breakfast is eggs 
(protein) and oatmeal (natural carb). A dinner example is chicken (protein) with rice and vegetables 
(natural carbs). There are several important reasons why we combine the macronutrients this way. 
Five Reasons to Eat Lean Proteins and Natural Carbs Together at Every Meal 
1.  For building muscle, it‘s optimal to eat protein at regular intervals throughout the day. Protein 
can‘t be stored in your body like carbohydrates. If you eat too many meals without protein, your 
body doesn‘t have the raw material it needs to build new muscle and may even break down the 
muscle you have. 
2.  Studies have proven that protein has an appetite-suppressing effect and makes you feel fuller. 
Lean proteins are also hard to overeat, while carbs are easy to overeat, so moderating your carbs 
and eating a lean protein at every meal is a great way to help control your calories. 
3.  Out of all the macronutrients, protein has the highest thermic effect (providing a boost to your 
metabolism) because of the extra energy required to digest and utilize it. A meal that has only 
carbs is less thermic than one that includes protein. A meal that‘s high in fat without protein is 
the least thermic of all. 
4.  Muscle glycogen is the primary source of energy for weight lifting and high-intensity exercise, 
but your glycogen stores are limited and must be continuously replenished by eating carbs. If 
you eat only protein meals, without carbs, your glycogen levels get chronically depleted, your 
performance declines, and your recovery suffers. Even if you have a carb-intolerant body type or 
you prefer carb-restricted diets, it‘s important to get some carbs in your meals every day to 
support your training. 
5.  If you suffer from nagging hunger, cravings, or hypoglycemia, it‘s often from eating too many 
sugars and processed carbs by themselves. Instead, eat natural carbs in meals that also contain 
fiber, lean protein, and healthy fats. This balanced combination slows the digestion of the carbs, 

================================================================================
resulting in steadier energy levels, more stable blood sugar levels, and a more controlled output 
of insulin. 
In this program, our definition of a complete and balanced meal is one that contains a lean protein 
and a natural carb. We can take this meal template a step further in nutritional quality by making sure 
we include vegetables in the natural carb part of most of our meals. That makes the ultimate meal 
combination a lean protein, a starchy carb, and a fibrous carb. 
A dinner example is chicken breast (lean protein), brown rice (starchy carb), and oriental vegetables 
(fibrous carbs). A breakfast example is scrambled eggs (lean protein) and old-fashioned oatmeal 
(starchy carb) with spinach and mushrooms (fibrous carbs). You can add fruit into this meal template 
instead of (or in addition to) the vegetables (for example, eggs, oatmeal, and blueberries). Many dairy 
products are good sources of protein, so if you traded the eggs for a Greek yogurt, you‘d have the 
same lean protein and natural carbs combination. You‘ll get more meal planning ideas when you get 
to Chapter 14. 
THE POWER OF DOING NUTRITION BY THE NUMBERS 
When customizing meal plans, some people get overwhelmed by the thought of crunching the 
numbers for all these foods. The good news is, with spreadsheets or software, it‘s easy. Using our 
lean-protein-plus-natural-carbs meal template is by itself a simple quick-start shortcut. Start each meal 
with that combination and your numbers will already be in the ballpark: All you have to do is tweak 
the protein, carb, or fat portions up or down a little if you want to hit your calorie and macronutrient 
targets on the bull‘s-eye. 
Like calories, you could guesstimate your macros as long as you‘re getting the results you want, but 
if you‘re not satisfied with your results, it‘s time to get serious about tracking numbers. If you‘re a 
beginner, premade meal plans make it easy to get started fast. But there‘s nothing more powerful for 
understanding and customizing nutrition than doing meal plans by the numbers and fine-tuning those 
numbers as you go, based on your results. 
Bodybuilding nutritionist to the pros Chris Aceto agrees. In his book, Everything You Need to Know 
About Fat Loss, he writes, ―I feel that number crunching is a very important part of learning about 
nutrition. You will never be able to build an exact diet, one that really works, and one that is built 
especially for you, without knowing how to count calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat.‖ 
Creating meal plans by the numbers gives you the kind of nutritional precision that puts you in 
complete control of your results. It enables you to easily troubleshoot plateaus, accelerate your fat 
loss, or dial yourself into peak condition on the date of your choosing. This is how the leanest people 
in the world do it. 
Your ratios must be customized, but as you‘ll learn shortly, there is a sensible place—a baseline—
where everyone can start. 
MACRONUTRIENT PERCENTAGES DEFINED 
A macronutrient ratio is simply the percentage of your total calories that come from protein, 
carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. To create a meal plan by the numbers, you start with your daily 
calorie goal, which you calculated in the previous chapter. Then you choose your macronutrient goals 
and divvy up the calories. Think of it as slicing a pie. For example, if you sliced your daily nutritional 
―pie‖ into three equal portions, the ratios would be 33⅓ percent carbohydrate, 33⅓ percent protein, 
and 33⅓ percent fat. 

================================================================================
How do you define a low-carb or high-carb diet? When is a nutrition program considered high 
protein? What does a high-fat diet really mean? Drawing a line is difficult, but for the purpose of our 
discussion, let‘s clarify what we‘re talking about when we refer to high, medium, and low 
macronutrient percentages. 
CARBOHYDRATE DEFINITIONS 
Carbohydrate Level 
Percentage of Total Calories 
Very high carb 
65%–70%+ 
High carb 
55%–60% 
Moderate carb 
40%–50% 
Low carb

How do you know what percentage is ideal? There‘s no best way for everyone. One tip is to avoid 
extremes. For improving body composition, the best approach for most people is moderate carbs, 
moderate fat, and moderate to high protein. That‘s what you call balance! From this starting point, you 
can modify and customize based on how you respond. 
Ironically, in the diet world, it‘s the extremes that often attract the most attention, especially low 
carb and low fat. Before we talk about finding the ideal baseline in the sensible middle, let‘s look at 
these two extremes. 
VERY LOW FAT 
In the 1980s and early ‘90s, the most popular trend was the low-fat diet. This came with very high 
carbs. Some of the best-selling programs at that time recommended macronutrient ratios of around 70 
percent carbs, 20 percent protein, and 10 percent fat. They‘re not as popular today, but plenty of diets 
still promote the very low-fat approach. Proponents believe that fat makes you fat and that dietary fat 
causes heart disease and other health problems, so fats are said to be the ―bad macronutrient.‖ These 
ideas have all been challenged. 
If you keep your calories in a deficit, you will lose weight on very low-fat, high-carb diets. If the 
carbs are carefully chosen and include nutrient, phytochemical, and fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains, and natural starches, this could also be a healthy way for some people to eat. But problems 
always exist with extreme diets of any kind. Potential problems with the very low-fat approach include 
falling short on essential fatty acids, being too low in protein for serious strength training (which 
doesn‘t support your efforts to build muscle), and having too many carbs for carb-intolerant people 
(which doesn‘t support your efforts to burn fat or maintain good health). 
VERY LOW CARB 
At the other extreme, you have the very low-carb diets. Some are high in fat and protein. Others, like 
the ketogenic diets, are very high in fat and lower in protein. The amount of carbs in a low-carb diet 
can vary from as high as 35 percent to as low as 10 percent and occasionally you hear about the ultra-

================================================================================
extreme zero-carb diets. Supporters claim that carbs are driving obesity because carbs stimulate 
insulin and insulin causes fat storage. Therefore, carbs are said to be the ―bad macronutrient.‖ Like the 
low-fat diet, these ideas have also been challenged. 
There are legitimate concerns about excessive carb intake. Many people are getting an overdose of 
sugar and not enough lean protein or healthy fat. Unfortunately, the concerns about carbs have been 
blown out of proportion, creating unwarranted fear. Carbs are not fattening outside of the easy calorie 
overload they cause if you‘re not careful with portions. Also, not every body type has trouble 
metabolizing carbs. Most athletes thrive on them and exercise can improve anyone‘s carb tolerance 
and insulin sensitivity. Carb restriction can be a good way to accelerate fat loss, but that‘s not saying 
carbs make you fat. 
THE ORIGINAL BODYBUILDER’S DIET 
The 60‒30‒10 nutrient ratio is the program I originally used when I first started bodybuilding. When I 
began competing, it was the early 1990s, right in the middle of the fat phobia era. My nutrition plan 
was high in natural carbs and low in fats simply because that diet was in vogue and widely accepted. 
So I conformed and did what everyone else was doing. It worked. The 60‒30‒10 ratio was effective 
for fat loss and I felt strong and energetic. That shouldn‘t be surprising, because I was tracking my 
calorie deficit, the protein was adequate, and I found that my body type handles carbs fairly well. I 
later discovered that one small adjustment improved my results even further. 
It wasn‘t until the late ‘90s that I really began to reach my best physical condition, winning multiple 
overall bodybuilding titles and looking my absolute best ever. For years I turned myself into a human 
guinea pig, experimenting with every diet imaginable from very high-carb, zero-fat diets to high-fat, 
zero-carb ketogenic diets, and I finally stumbled onto a formula that worked beautifully. 
With this change, I gained more muscle in the off-season, burned more fat in the contest season 
(dropping below 4 percent body fat at my all-time lowest) and stayed leaner year round, maintaining a 
9 percent body fat percentage without much difficulty. I also moved up a full weight class. I was 
stronger. My energy was better. My mental focus was sharper. 
What was this adjustment? Believe it or not, I ate more fat. I dropped the carbs by 10 percent and 
replaced it with healthy fat sources such as nuts (like almonds and walnuts), natural peanut butter, 
fatty fish like salmon, flaxseed oil, and extra virgin olive oil. I also allowed myself some red meat and 
one or two egg yolks a day (instead of only egg whites, the bodybuilder‘s staple protein). 
In the next chapter, you‘ll learn everything you‘ll ever need to know about dietary fats. For now it‘s 
enough to say that adding some ―good fats‖ is vitally important for optimizing your health and 
improving your body composition. 
BURN THE FAT BASELINE NUTRITION: YOUR STARTING POINT 
My small adjustment to 50 percent carbs, 30 percent protein, and 20 percent fat not only worked well 
for me, it also worked for the majority of my training clients and coaching protégés over a period of 
many years. My personal experience and the results from my clients, combined with what the research 
said, convinced me that this was a good place to start and it became the baseline of the Burn the Fat, 
Feed the Muscle program. 
Do your goals include burning fat and transforming your body? Do you want to achieve these goals 
in a healthy, balanced way without losing muscle or energy? Are you already training or planning to 

================================================================================
start training? If so, it‘s hard to go wrong with 50 percent carbohydrates, 30 percent protein, and 20 
percent fat as your starting point as well. 
The 50‒30‒20 macronutrient split is not a rigid prescription. Five percent either way won‘t make 
that much difference, but you might want to adjust your starting numbers slightly depending on your 
goals, preferences, past experience, and body type. Highly active athletes might start at 55 percent 
carbs. For endomorphic or carb-intolerant types, they might find 45 percent carbs is a better starting 
point. Many strength and physique athletes start at 35 percent protein because they believe it supports 
the intensity of their weight training better. 
Some people make adjustments purely for personal preference reasons. For example, they might 
find their meals more enjoyable, their hunger reduced, or their energy levels higher when eating more 
fat, so they might start with 5 percent more fat than the baseline. 
Once you‘re off and running, you‘ll probably make even more adjustments over the weeks and 
months you‘re pursuing your goal. The most common is to reduce the carbs and increase the lean 
protein (and sometimes the healthy fat) when you want to accelerate fat loss or break a plateau. But 
before you can make any of these types of changes, you need to establish a baseline plan and get some 
feedback on how it‘s working. 
ESTABLISH A FOUNDATION FIRST, THEN EXPERIMENT, 
ADJUST, AND CUSTOMIZE 
Whenever you want to master a new subject or acquire a new skill, you must learn the basics first. If 
you have a shaky foundation, then nothing else you do will matter; your castle will crumble. As 
Emerson wrote, ―The height of the pinnacle is determined by the breadth of the base.‖ 
Remember the 80‒20 rule. That‘s the efficiency principle, which says that 20 percent of your 
actions—the vital few—will produce the majority of your results. The other 80 percent—the trivial 
many—is minutiae. Most people are wasting their time on the small stuff. They‘re constantly chasing 
after magic food combinations, exotic fat-burning berries, or weird diet hacks, all the while missing 
the simplest and most obvious factors that would make the biggest impact on their physiques. 
On Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle you‘ll do the opposite of the quick-fix diets: You‘ll nail down the 
fundamentals first. It starts with calories and macronutrients. You‘ll establish a baseline for those 
numbers and measure the results. If the baseline nutrition produces good results, you don‘t have to 
change anything. If not, then you start to experiment, tweak, and adjust. 
If you want to experiment with the little details, from macronutrient ratios to food substitutions or 
eliminations to meal-timing tweaks, you should. It‘s the fine-tuning you do over time that helps you 
customize your plan and squeeze out that extra few percent in results that most people leave on the 
table. 
But skip the weird stuff and don‘t jump into anything too advanced, aggressive, or restrictive until 
after you establish a baseline of fundamentals, get into a feedback loop, and start charting your results. 
With real-world progress data, you can see how your body is responding to all the variables and make 
the right adjustments at the right time. 
Adjustments for Nutrient Ratios by Body Type 
The right macronutrient amounts can vary depending on your body type, your goals, and your training 
volume and style. Bodybuilders, for example, thrive on more protein than people who are sedentary. 
Endurance athletes sometimes require calorie and carb intakes that start where the average person‘s 

================================================================================
end. Although competitive bodybuilders and endurance athletes represent the far ends of the fitness 
spectrum, they help illustrate how important it is to customize. 
MESOMORPH 
The mesomorph could probably follow almost any nutrient ratio and still get results. I know some 
mesomorphs on the 50‒50 diet: 50 percent McDonald‘s and 50 percent pizza. They still grow muscle 
like weeds and have ripped abs. I‘m not endorsing this approach, just making a point. If our 
genetically gifted mesomorph friends would be more meticulous with their macros and choose more 
nutritious foods, they would get even better results. The baseline plan—50 percent carbs, 30 percent 
protein, and 20 percent fat—would work as well as any. 
ECTOMORPH 
The ectomorph usually isn‘t concerned with losing body fat. Usually his goal is to gain muscle, and 
for gaining muscle the baseline plan with 50 percent carbs, 30 percent protein, and 20 percent fat is 
also a good starting point. An ectomorph rarely needs to restrict carbs. Sometimes eating more fat 
(snacking on nuts, for example) helps ectomorphs hit their surplus, because dietary fat is calorie dense. 
ENDOMORPH 
It‘s the endomorph who needs to pay the most attention to macronutrient ratios, especially the carbs. 
Overweight endomorphs are usually more carb intolerant than the general population and have a 
natural tendency for less activity, so reducing carbs is their most common food adjustment. Some 
endomorphs might want to start closer to 40 percent to 45 percent carbs, then consider whether to cut 
more based on their weekly results. 
Adjustments to the Baseline Ratios for Accelerating Fat Loss 
For short periods when maximum fat loss is the goal, the macronutrient ratios can be shifted to more 
protein and less carbs. In physique sports, where you see some of the leanest bodies in the world, 40 
percent carbs, 40 percent protein, and 20 percent fat is one of the most popular macronutrient splits 
during the fat-loss phase. 
Reducing carbs and increasing protein can give you some measurable advantages when it comes to 
fat loss. It increases metabolism through the thermic effect of food, helps reduce hunger, makes 
calorie control easier, and protects lean body mass when the calorie deficit gets aggressive. 
The best way to do it is to cut sugar as much as possible and reduce your intake of calorie-dense 
starches and grains (pasta, bread, rice, potatoes, cereal, and so on). That leaves the less calorie-dense 
fibrous carbs (such as green vegetables and salads), lean proteins, and healthy fats. 
When carb restriction is too extreme, there‘s an increased risk of side effects such as hunger, low 
energy, loss of lean tissue, and the dreaded ―brain fog.‖ Fortunately, even a small reduction in carbs 
can help accelerate fat loss without the side effects of extreme low carbs. Carb cycling strategies help 
as well. We‘ll take a closer look at how to accelerate fat loss with these advanced techniques in 
Chapter 18. 
QUICK START 
If you’re metabolically healthy and active, aim for 50% carbs, 30% protein, and 20% fat as 
your baseline. If you’re an endomorph or you want to accelerate fat loss, decrease the carbs, and 
increase the protein (40% carbs, 40% protein, and 20% fat is super-popular among fitness 

================================================================================
models and physique athletes). Using nutrition tracking spreadsheets or software makes 
calculating your macronutrient ratios a cinch! But if you make sure to eat a lean protein, a 
fibrous vegetable, and a natural starchy carb with every meal, your numbers will be in the 
ballpark, automatically! 
THE SPREADSHEET METHOD FOR MEAL PLANNING 
A simple way to estimate your nutrient ratios for an individual meal is to follow the 3‒2‒1 rule. 
Imagine your plate divided into six sections like slices of a pie. Fill up three slices (
3/6, or 50 percent) 
with natural carbs like potatoes, yams, oatmeal, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Fill up two 
sections (
2/6, or 33 percent) with lean proteins like egg whites, chicken, and fish. Finish with one 
section of fat (
1/6, or 17 percent). This easy method puts you very close to the optimal ratios and you 
don‘t need to be a math whiz to figure it out. 
The best and most accurate technique for meal calculations is free, and you probably already have it 
on your laptop or desktop computer: It‘s a plain old spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel. 
These days, there‘s also no shortage of nutrition apps and software for creating meal plans, 
including our own custom-made Burn the Fat Meal Planner, which is available with a subscription to 
our members-only Inner Circle community at www.BurnTheFatInnerCircle.com. These tools make 
meal planning easy because the spreadsheets are built in and they do all the math for you; all you have 
to do is set your goal numbers and choose the foods you like. They‘re also convenient because they 
have large food databases and they‘re compatible with mobile devices or smartphones. 
To calculate your ratios, take your total caloric goal for the day (which you calculated in the 
previous chapter) and multiply it by your target percentage of each macronutrient. Then, divide the 
calories from each macronutrient by the calorie content per gram. You‘ll need to know the following 
three conversions, also known as the Atwater factors, to calculate your ratios: 
1 gram of carbohydrate = 4 calories 
1 gram of protein = 4 calories 
1 gram of fat = 9 calories 
I‘ve crunched the numbers for you in the two examples below. These represent the typical man or 
woman. These numbers are a good starting point, but you‘ll need to customize based on your own 
personal calorie needs. 
For men, here is an example of a 2,300-calorie-per-day fat-loss plan: 
Macronutrient 
Type 
Percentage of Total Calories 
Conversion to Grams 
Carbohydrates 50% 
0.50 × 2,300 calories = 1,150 calories from 
carbohydrates 
1,150 carb calories ÷ 4 calories per gram = 287 grams of 
carbs 
Protein 30% 
0.30 × 2,300 calories = 690 calories from protein 
690 protein calories ÷ 4 calories per gram = 172 grams of 
protein 
Fat 20% 
0.20 × 2,300 calories = 460 calories from fat 
460 fat calories ÷ 9 calories per gram = 51 grams of fat 

================================================================================
For women, here is an example for a 1,600-calorie-per-day fat-loss plan: 
Macronutrient 
Type 
Percentage of Total Calories 
Conversion to Grams 
Carbohydrates 50% 
0.50 × 1,600 calories = 800 calories from 
carbohydrates 
800 carb calories ÷ 4 calories per gram = 200 grams of carbs 
Protein 30% 
0.30 × 1,600 calories = 480 calories from protein 
480 protein calories ÷ 4 calories per gram = 120 grams of 
protein 
Fat 20% 
0.20 × 1,600 calories = 320 calories from fat 
320 fat calories ÷ 9 calories per gram = 35 grams of fat 
If you hit your targets at every meal, then your entire day will take care of itself, but you don‘t have 
to worry about making every meal have the same amount of carbs and total calories. It‘s okay if your 
meals vary in size. For example, your post-workout meals may be larger and contain more carbs. Or if 
you‘re a big breakfast eater like I am, your first meal may have more carbs and calories as well. 
Your primary goal is to come as close to your macronutrient target as possible when you add it all 
up for the day. Don‘t worry about being perfect. If you try to micromanage your macronutrients, 
you‘ll probably just drive yourself crazy. If your protein, carb, and fat numbers are within 5 percent or 
so of your target in either direction, that‘s close enough. Your daily totals may not add up to exactly 
100 percent either. Nutrient information in databases and on food labels is usually estimated and often 
rounded off, so if you ever see your daily totals add up to only 98.7 percent, for example, it doesn‘t 
mean you made a mistake. 
COUCH POTATO NUTRITION VERSUS MUSCLE-BUILDING 
NUTRITION 
The recommendations in this chapter are designed to support people involved in resistance and cardio 
training programs. Some conservative or traditional nutritionists might tell you that the protein is too 
high. They might say that the government-mandated guidelines are sufficient. They might insist that 
the protein should be set at only 15 percent. That‘s couch potato advice. It has nothing to do with you 
if you‘re training hard and pursuing a body transformation goal. 
Your success with Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle will be based on how well you consistently 
combine all four elements of the program: nutrition, cardio training, weight training, and mental 
training. If you‘re not training hard, you‘re not following the program. If you‘re training hard, your 
nutrition needs are different from those of couch potatoes. 
When you see nutrient recommendations for the general population, keep in mind that the average 
person is not training and that minimum and optimum nutrition needs are two different concepts. If 
you want to get lean and muscular, then do what lean and muscular people do, and at the same time 
listen to your body so you can make the right adjustments for you. 
THERE’S NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL PRESCRIPTION 

================================================================================
Although it‘s wise to pursue a healthy balance between macronutrients, a single perfect ratio for 
everyone doesn‘t exist. 
✓ No ratio has any magical fat-burning or muscle-building properties. 
✓ No ratio will override the law of calorie balance. Any impact nutrient ratios have on weight loss 
is minimal compared to the effect of calorie levels. 
✓ No nutrient ratio will prevent metabolic slowdown if your calories are too low, too long. 
✓ No nutrient ratio will prevent you from gaining fat if your calories are too high. 
✓ No nutrient ratio will enable you to gain muscle if your calories are too low. 
✓ No nutrient ratio will work for everyone. Optimal nutrient ratios depend on goals, differences in 
body type, and carb tolerance. 
Macronutrient ratios aren‘t the singular key to fat loss, but they do give you a great way to set up 
your daily meal plans and ensure that you get optimal amounts of the major essential nutrients. 
Always remember, regardless of whether you eat high carb, low carb, or anywhere in between, if you 
eat too many calories, you won‘t burn fat. 
Start with the baseline and then experiment to find what works best for you. If you think high carbs 
are problematic for you, then drop the carbs and increase the protein and fat. If you think you‘re 
extremely carb intolerant, or you want to get ripped for a fitness competition, then bring down the 
carbs even lower, which bumps up the protein ratio, and see what happens. 
TRUSTING YOUR NUTRITION INTUITION 
Did you ever notice how some people gravitate toward a certain style of eating without anyone telling 
them to do it? Why do some people instinctively become vegetarians while others are heavy meat 
eaters? Why do some people avoid wheat and dairy? Why do some people crave certain foods? The 
reason is their bodies tell them so, and wisely, they listen. 
I‘m not vegetarian, but if your body tells you not to eat much meat, I believe you should listen and 
explore other protein sources. If your body tells you you‘re carb intolerant, listen. If you think your 
carbs are too low, listen. If a certain food disagrees with your stomach, listen. Listen to your body and 
pay attention to your results each week. 
If you navigated only by intuition, that would not be intelligent. You need a plan that‘s carefully 
structured. On the other hand, blindly following a program without the flexibility to make adjustments 
along the way is also a recipe for failure. Making the right weekly adjustments requires a scientific 
approach, real-world feedback, as well as a keen intuition. The people with the leanest and best bodies 
in the world are the ones who train hard, eat properly, track their results, and do what their bodies tell 
them to do. This is as true with macronutrients as it is with individual foods. 
In the next three chapters, we‘ll take a closer look at each one of the macronutrients. You‘ll learn 
everything you need to know about proteins, carbohydrates, and fats to get leaner, healthier, and more 
muscular.

CHAPTER 9 
Good Fats, Bad Fats 
Unfortunately for the much maligned lipid, fats and oils have been lumped together in the minds of 
most people as having the same properties, with the result of people trying to avoid ALL fats and oils 
for fear of adding body fat and looking like the Pillsbury Doughboy. Well, I am here to tell you that 
fats have gotten a bad rap. There are good fats and there are bad fats. The difference between the two 
is substantial and of great importance. 
—William D. Brink, author of Priming the Anabolic Environment: A Practical Scientific 
Guide to the Art and Science of Building Muscle 
THE MISSING LINK DISCOVERED: A DOSE OF ―HEALTHY FATS‖ 
In the last chapter I revealed how after a long period of practically zero-fat dieting, I took my results to 
a higher level with one small change: I ate more fat. But not too much fat, and not just any fat. As 
dietary fat expert Dr. Udo Erasmus says, ―There are fats that heal and fats that kill.‖ 
Adding the wrong kind of fats can clog your arteries, promote weight gain, and wreak havoc in your 
body. Adding the right kind of fats can turbocharge your energy, burn more fat, boost muscle-building 
hormones, improve blood sugar control, strengthen your joints, and enhance your skin tone. 
With benefits like these, good fats may sound like some kind of wonder drug, and in many respects 
the effects are almost drug-like. Surprisingly, you can get these miraculous results simply by eating 
small amounts of foods or oils rich in the healthy good fats while reducing or avoiding the unhealthy 
bad fats. 
THE ERA OF FAT PHOBIA 
The first time I picked up a barbell was in 1983, the heart of the ―fat phobia‖ era. During the 1980s 
and early ‘90s, the magazines, television, and nearly all the media pounded the message into our 
brains that fat was bad. No distinction was made between types of fats; the message was black-and-
white: ―Fat is unhealthy and fat makes you fat.‖ 
This spawned an entire industry of fat-free foods such as frozen dinners, lunch meats, candy, ice 
cream, yogurt, and nearly every other treat you can think of. This was the age of fat-free cookies and 
nonfat cakes, and almost all of us partook of these deliciously sweet and seemingly guilt-free goodies. 
We ate them without fear and believed it was healthy, since the labels said ―zero grams of fat‖! 
Even though dietary fat consumption decreased dramatically over the two decades that followed, a 
very strange thing happened: Waistlines and health problems continued to increase. According to U.S. 
government statistics, the adult obesity rate rose from 15 percent in 1980 to 32 percent in 2004. 
Today, two out of three adults are overweight or obese; heart disease and diabetes are still two of the 
biggest killers; and it seems there‘s no end in sight to these epidemics. 
If we cut down our fat intake so much in the ‘80s and ‘90s, then why did we continue getting fatter 
and sicker? Part of the answer is so obvious it‘s almost embarrassing: 

================================================================================
Fat-free doesn’t mean sugar-free or calorie-free! 
What happened is that many people cut the fat calories and simply replaced them with sugar 
calories. Even foods that always were fat-free suddenly started sporting new labels that proudly 
proclaimed, ―No fat!‖ A food may say ―fat-free‖ on the label but it could be 100 percent sugar! If you 
eat too much sugar, it doesn‘t matter how little dietary fat you eat: You‘ll still gain body fat. You‘ll 
probably get sick too. 
Most people have been conditioned to believe that eating fatty foods is the primary cause of health 
problems such as high cholesterol and heart attacks. There‘s no question, certain types of fats are 
unhealthy. What most people don‘t realize is that processed carbs and sugar can be even more harmful 
to your health and are every bit as responsible for climbing disease and obesity. The real culprit is an 
overload of processed foods, not one macronutrient. 
WHY A NONFAT DIET IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO A NONFAT 
BODY 
Previously, we defined a very low-fat diet as anything under 10 percent of total calories. On 2,300 
calories per day, that‘s 25 grams or less. On 1,600 calories, that‘s only 17 grams of fat per day. I‘ve 
consulted with clients who were proud of eating only 10 or 15 grams of fat per day. A few even 
boasted with excitement that they were eating almost zero grams! Ironically, they came to me because 
they were stuck and they couldn‘t get any leaner. 
I taught them not to fear all fats, to distinguish between the good fats and the bad, and to include 
small amounts of healthy fats in addition to their lean proteins and natural carbs. When they started 
eating the good fats, almost like magic, they had more energy, more strength, and better workouts, and 
the fat loss started coming again. 
Fat phobia is still so ingrained into dieting consciousness that most people are reluctant to add fat 
back in. To break free from fear of fat, it helps to understand the reasons why cutting it all out may do 
more harm than good. 
The biggest problem is that by trying to eat a nonfat diet, many people inadvertently cut out the 
healthy fats along with the unhealthy ones. A deficiency in essential fatty acids can cause a long list of 
health issues, including skin and hair problems, joint pain, fatigue, depression, cardiovascular 
diseases, and reduced metabolism. Nonfat diets are also correlated with low testosterone levels. You 
need a little bit of fat—even the saturated kind—to maintain normal anabolic hormone levels. 
When you eat pure carbs and no fat, this can also aggravate blood sugar problems in those who are 
susceptible, develop into metabolic syndrome, and eventually lead to type 2 diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease. Eating healthy fat (and fiber) slows digestion, which helps control blood sugar 
and insulin more effectively. This makes fats especially important for people who are carb intolerant. 
Most surprising to many, eating nothing but nonfat, high-carb meals can sabotage your fat-loss 
goals by increasing hunger. After eating carbs without fiber or fat, your blood sugar peaks and quickly 
crashes, leaving you with that shaky, empty I-have-to-eat-now-or-I‘m-going-to-pass-out feeling. It‘s 
more than an emotional craving for a specific food; it‘s physical hunger and it‘s hard to resist. 
Cutting out all fat is not the answer. You need to eat fat. On the other hand, you don‘t want too 
much. 
THE TRUTH ABOUT HIGH-FAT DIETS 

================================================================================
Most people believe that a low-carb diet is a high-protein diet, but that‘s not always the case. 
Ketogenic low-carb diets are actually high in fat, with modest amounts of protein and of course very 
few carbs. Despite being extremely unbalanced in macronutrients, these controversial diets attract a lot 
of interest. Advocates say that the metabolic state of ketosis produces greater fat loss than other diets. 
That claim has never been proven. They also claim a high fat intake is not inherently unhealthy. On 
this point, they‘re not entirely wrong. 
The Greenland Eskimo diet is mostly meat and fat (60 percent), but the Eskimos stay perfectly 
healthy. The cardio-protective omega-3 fatty acids in the marine foods they eat (fish and whale 
blubber) may explain their low incidence of disease. That‘s a far cry from the high-fat diets of modern 
Americans, which include factory-farmed meats, hydrogenated oils, baked goods, fried foods, refined 
cooking oils, and other processed fats, often eaten in combination with refined grains and sugar. 
Conventional wisdom says that everyone should follow a low-fat diet. But some people are going 
against the grain of convention and it seems to be working for them. People do lose weight on 
ketogenic and other types of higher-fat diets. The real question is which type of program is ideal for 
transforming your body? All it takes to lose weight is a calorie deficit. It takes a lot more to develop a 
great body and maintain it. 
There‘s little or no evidence that high-fat, low-carb diets are better for fat loss than balanced diets or 
less extreme low-carb diets. They clearly fall short in the muscle-building department. Ketogenic diets 
that are low in carbs and high in fat still have an enthusiastic cult following in the mainstream weight-
loss world. But they‘ve never been the nutrition plan of choice in the physique world, where training 
is such an important part of the lifestyle. 
For high-intensity training, muscle glycogen is your body‘s preferred and most efficient fuel. 
Glycogen is restored by eating carbs. If you eat too much fat, it displaces your carbs and depletes your 
glycogen, which may make your training suffer. If your training suffers, your muscle gains suffer. 
Even worse, studies have shown that training in a glycogen-depleted state has catabolic effects on 
muscle and decreases protein synthesis. 
There are good fats that we benefit from eating in small amounts, but we don‘t need that much! It‘s 
also the quality of fat, not just the quantity, that matters. In the next section you‘ll learn which fats you 
should eat more of, which you should eat less of, and which you should avoid completely. To choose 
your fats properly, you need to understand the differences between them. 
THE TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES OF FATS 
Fatty acids are made from chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms linked together. The differences in 
their molecular structure give each fat its unique properties, such as its melting point, its ―stickiness‖ 
in the blood, and how it affects your health. The structure of every fat or oil is either saturated or 
unsaturated. 
1. Saturated fat 
Butter, cheese, dairy fat, chocolate, egg yolk, meat fat, shortening, palm oil, palm kernel oil, milk fat, 
and coconut oil are all saturated fats. With the exception of the tropical oils (palm, palm kernel, and 
coconut), saturated fats are primarily animal fats. 
Saturated fats, with the exception of the tropical oils, are solid or semisolid at room temperature 
(think butter or animal fat). Saturated fats have historically been considered the least desirable because 
they can raise blood cholesterol. 

================================================================================
The long-standing traditional advice has been to reduce saturated fat intake. However, without 
looking at each different type of saturated fatty acid individually and within the context of your 
genetics, health status, lifestyle, quantity eaten, and overall diet, it‘s overly simplistic to say that all 
saturated fats are bad for you or should be completely avoided. Saturated fats do, however, lack the 
essential fatty acids you need, so you must balance them with the unsaturated fats. 
2. Unsaturated fat 
Unsaturated fats are subdivided into polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats and they come 
primarily from vegetable and plant sources. They are mostly liquid at room temperature (think olive 
oil). Generally, they tend to lower levels of blood cholesterol and have other health benefits or cardio-
protective effects. The polyunsaturated fats contain the healthy essential fatty acids (EFAs).

ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS 
Like other essential nutrients such as amino acids, essential fatty acids are those that your body can‘t 
make on its own, so they must be supplied through your diet in the right amounts and in the right 
ratios. The two primary EFAs are: 
Omega-3 (alpha linolenic, or LNA) 
Omega-6 (linoleic acid, or LA) 
According to Artemis P. Simopoulos, author of The Omega Diet: The Lifesaving Nutritional 
Program Based on the Diet of the Island of Crete, human beings evolved on a diet that was not only 
free of man-made trans-fatty acids and lower in saturated fat than the modern diet, it also contained 
roughly equal amounts of omega-3 and omega-6. The modern Western diet today is very high in 
omega-6 fatty acids as compared to omega-3 with a ratio of 20:1 or even higher (optimal is more like 
2:1). 
One of the reasons for this imbalance is our increased consumption of refined grains and decreased 
consumption of omega-3-rich fish, as well as the industrial production of animal feeds containing 
grains high in omega-6 fatty acids. Since animals are what they eat, their meat becomes high in 
omega-6, unlike the leaner and higher omega-3 wild game that our ancestors once ate. 
As we consume high-omega-6 meats and refined grains, we lose the natural balance we once 
thrived on and begin to suffer from inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases that were once unheard-
of. By increasing your intake of omega-3 fats, you obtain a long list of health benefits, restoring you to 
the balance that nature intended. 
The Amazing Benefits of Essential Fatty Acids 
Most people don‘t get enough omega-3 fatty acids, and their omega-3-to-omega-6 ratio is skewed 
badly in favor of the pro-inflammatory omega-6. Here are some of omega-3‘s most important 
functions in your body: 
✓ EFAs improve insulin sensitivity. 
✓ EFAs are required for absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. 
✓ EFAs are essential for joint health. 
✓ EFAs are required for energy production. 
✓ EFAs are required for oxygen transfer. 
✓ EFAs maintain cell membrane integrity. 
✓ EFAs suppress cortisol production. 
✓ EFAs improve skin texture. 

================================================================================
✓ EFAs promote muscle growth. 
✓ EFAs increase your metabolic rate. 
✓ EFAs help burn fat. 
It takes only a small amount of EFAs to prevent a deficiency, but if you want to maximize fat loss, 
muscular development and physical performance, your goal is to get optimal amounts of every 
nutrient, not just to avoid deficiency. You can achieve this by adding at least one rich source of 
omega-3 into your meal plan every day. 
Fatty fish is the best source of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). You get protein at the same time, making it a true ―superfood.‖ Eating 
fatty fish at least two or three times per week is recommended by almost every major health authority. 
Omega-3 fats are also found in rich amounts in plant sources including flaxseeds and walnuts. Small 
amounts are found in dark leafy greens like kale, collard greens, and spinach and some other types of 
seeds. 
Ground flaxseed is another way to get omega-3 fats and it‘s also a great source of fiber (about 3 
grams per tablespoon). Flaxseeds (or flax meal) can be used as an ingredient in baking, cooking, and 
special healthy recipes. You can mix flaxseeds in protein shakes, stir them into oatmeal, or sprinkle 
them on salads. It‘s best if you grind the seeds so you can fully digest them. It takes about 3 
tablespoons of ground flaxseeds to equal the amount of EFAs in one tablespoon of oil.

Essential Fatty Acid Supplements: Fish Oil and Flax Oil 
It‘s possible to get all the healthy fats you need from food, but omega-3 fats are so important, many 
people take a supplement to be certain they‘re getting optimal amounts on a daily basis. Two of the 
most popular are fish oil and flax oil. Supplements can never take the place of whole foods. However, 
if you take an essential fatty acid supplement, meal planning is easier because you don‘t need to stress 
over whether you included an omega-3 whole food every day. 
Research on fish oil suggests that 1.5 to 2.0 grams per day of combined DHA/EPA is the ideal dose 
for supporting fat-loss programs. A big guy might go with as much as 3.0 grams. There are studies 
that tested higher doses for specific health ailments, but the American Heart Association warns against 
taking more than 3.0 grams of combined EPA/DHA per day without a physician‘s supervision because 

================================================================================
of potential side effects, including increased bleeding time. I recommend consulting your doctor 
before taking any supplements. 
Flaxseed oil is the richest plant-based source of omega-3, with twice the omega-3 content of fish 
oil. The type of omega-3 fat in flaxseed oil is alpha-linolenic acid, which requires conversion in your 
body to the usable forms, EPA and DHA. There‘s been debate about how well your body makes this 
conversion and whether flax oil is better than fish oil. Over the last decade, mounting research has 
made fish oil the darling of the health and fitness world and the most popular choice for a healthy fat 
supplement. In any case, flax is an extremely rich source of omega-3 fat and it‘s the top choice for 
vegetarians or anyone else who doesn‘t eat fish. 
One tablespoon of flax oil per day is a typical dose; unusually large or active people might take 
more. Flaxseed oil is sensitive to heat, so it‘s not meant for cooking. However, you can add it to foods 
after cooking, as well as to salads or protein shakes. Flaxseed oil goes rancid quickly, so buy it 
refrigerated, keep it refrigerated, and use it quickly once you open the container. 
Like all whole food sources of fats and oils, essential fatty acid supplements have calories. If you 
use any supplements, be sure to add the calories and grams of fat into your daily totals. 
INCLUDE SATURATED FATS IN MODERATION 
Cutting out all saturated fats isn‘t necessary, but they should make up only a small portion of your 
total calories and total fat intake. This leaves room for the other macronutrients and other types of fat, 
respectively. Most health and nutrition organizations recommend limiting saturated fat to 10 percent 
of your daily calories and splitting the remainder between 10 percent mono- and 10 percent 
polyunsaturated fats. By following the food suggestions in this chapter, you won‘t need to worry about 
crunching those numbers: They will automatically be in the ballpark. 
Small amounts of saturated fat tag along with your protein when you eat meat and poultry. You can 
keep the fat and calories to a minimum by picking the leanest cuts possible. If you eat red meat for 
your protein meals, it will also include some fat. Grass-fed beef is popular because it‘s leaner, it‘s 
lower in calories, it‘s lower in saturated fat, and it has a better omega-3-to-omega-6 ratio than grain-
fed beef. 
Eggs are another protein food that also contains fat (in the yolk). Many bodybuilders are known for 
eating egg whites when they want more protein with fewer calories. However, the idea that you 
shouldn‘t eat any whole eggs because they raise cholesterol and cause heart disease has been strongly 
challenged in recent years. There‘s a growing body of evidence that eating one or two whole eggs per 
day has no negative effects on cholesterol. Eating larger amounts of whole eggs may increase blood 
cholesterol, but research shows that the good HDL cholesterol goes up with the bad LDL, it doesn‘t 
alter the ratio, and the type of larger LDL particle that does go up is the less harmful kind. Other 
studies have failed to find a cause-and-effect link between egg consumption and heart disease. 
Egg yolks also contain valuable nutrients including zeaxanthin and lutein, which help protect you 
from macular degeneration. Some eggs are higher in omega-3 fat because of what they feed the hens 
(flaxseed meal or marine algae). Omega-3-enriched whole eggs aren‘t a replacement for fatty fish, but 
they can give your omega-3 intake a little bump. Whole eggs are also filling. Research from the 
University of Connecticut found that eating whole eggs at breakfast stabilized blood glucose, reduced 
levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin, and reduced calorie intake for the day. 
Saturated fats are also found in dairy products. Many people avoid dairy completely because they 
have a hard time digesting it. However, if you tolerate dairy products well, you can use them on a fat-
loss program. In fact, recent research links eating dairy products with better body composition. Dairy 
products are also an excellent source of calcium and two very high-quality proteins: whey and casein. 

================================================================================
If you want to minimize saturated fat, limit the calories, and get more protein, choose nonfat or 
reduced-fat dairy products. 
Butter is best kept to small amounts because it provides lots of calories but no essential fatty acids. 
There are now many lower-calorie substitutes for conventional fats, such as butter-flavor sprinkles, 
low-calorie butter-flavor sprays, reduced-fat butter spreads, fat-free dressings, cooking spray, and so 
on. These can all save you calories while keeping some flavor. (Read the labels carefully, though, 
because not all low-calorie products or fat substitutes are good for you.) 
Unrefined extra virgin coconut oil has become increasingly popular, shedding its past reputation as 
a fat to avoid. Many enjoy it because you can cook with it and use it to add flavor to recipes. Coconut 
oil sometimes gets promoted as a health food and even a weight-loss aid. While you can certainly 
include it as part of your daily fat intake, there‘s no evidence it will help you lose weight. If you‘re not 
careful, the calorie density of oils can actually sabotage your weight loss. 
CONTROL FAT TO CONTROL CALORIES 
Many fats and oils have healthy properties, but they‘re all calorie dense, with more than twice the 
calories per gram than protein or carbs. Extra virgin olive oil, for example, contains phenolic 
compounds that are powerful antioxidants, making it a healthy choice (great for salad dressings and 
low- to medium-heat cooking). However, olive oil is a high-calorie food. One tablespoon will set you 
back about 130 calories and 14 grams of fat. 
If you need to save calories, using cooking spray is more calorically economical than pouring oil in 
your pan because it takes a 15-second spray to equal the calories in 1 tablespoon of oil. 
Nuts are little nutrition powerhouses. They give you fiber, vitamins, healthy phytonutrients, and 
good fats (walnuts are high in omega-3). But if you eat large amounts of walnuts, almonds, 
macadamia nuts, cashews, or peanuts as snacks without keeping track of calories, you could be 
hundreds or even a thousand calories over your optimal fat-burning level! 
Ironically, a common reason for fat-loss plateaus is eating too much healthy food, and healthy fats 
are a prime culprit. Keeping your meal plan lower in fat overall helps you to control your calories and 
that makes it easier to get leaner. You simply need to dole out enough healthy fat so you get the 
nutrition you do need without calories you don‘t need. 
FATS TO AVOID: HYDROGENATED, PARTIALLY 
HYDROGENATED, AND TRANS-FATTY ACIDS 
Oils are, by nature, unstable substances that go rancid quickly with exposure to light and air. 
Hydrogenation and partial hydrogenation are industrial processes that food companies use to prolong 
the shelf life of their products and make cheap spreadable products such as margarine. They also make 
baked goods moist and flaky. Udo Erasmus calls hydrogenated oils ―a manufacturer‘s dream: an 
unspoilable substance that lasts forever.‖ 
Unfortunately, hydrogenation turns a natural, healthy fat into an unnatural, unhealthy fat. You could 
say that hydrogenated oil is a processed fat the same way that white flour is a processed carbohydrate. 
Partially hydrogenated oils contain large amounts of chemically altered fats known as trans-fatty 
acids, one of the unhealthiest foods you can eat. 
Some trans-fatty acids are found in meats and dairy products, but those are the naturally occurring 
variety. Industrial trans fats are found in hydrogenated oils, margarines and spreads, baked goods, and 
fried foods. Food companies used to be sneaky when it came to trans fats, because until 2006 it wasn‘t 

================================================================================
mandatory by law to list them on food labels. The labels said ―no cholesterol‖ or ―low saturated fat,‖ 
yet the products were loaded with harmful trans fats. Many people switched from butter to margarine 
thinking they were doing good by avoiding saturated fat. What they missed was that the margarine 
was full of trans fats! 
When piles of convincing research proved how dangerous these fats were, the government finally 
changed the labeling laws. Yet today there are still labeling loopholes that allow small amounts of 
trans fats to sneak into many foods: The label can say ―no trans fats‖ as long as the amount doesn‘t 
exceed 0.5 grams per serving. They still could be hiding in foods you may be eating every day; again, 
read the labels carefully. 
Where Are the Trans-fatty Acids? 
• Fried foods (fried chicken, french fries, fried onion rings, etc.) 
• Cookies 
• Crackers 
• Biscuits 
• Pies 
• Pastries 
• Frostings 
• Doughnuts 
• Corn chips 
• Taco shells 
• Shortening 
• Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils 
• Refined vegetable oils 
• Packaged baked goods (croutons, crackers, cookies, cakes, some breads) 
• Margarine 
What Trans-fatty Acids Can Do to Your Body 
Trans-fatty acids cause numerous health problems, including heart disease. A 2 percent increase in 
calorie intake from trans fats is associated with a 23 percent increase in cardiovascular disease risk. 
Trans-fatty acids in hydrogenated oil also raise bad cholesterol (LDL) and triglyceride levels while 
reducing good cholesterol (HDL). Trans fats may also slow down the fat-burning process in more 
ways than one. 
The American Heart Association recommends a maximum of 2 grams per day, but some experts say 
there‘s no safe amount of trans-fatty acids. Referring to hydrogenated oils, Dr. Erasmus says, ―If you 
see the ‗H‘ word on the label, get the ‗H‘ out of there!‖ 
12 Destructive Effects of Trans Fats 
• Trans fat raises LDL (bad) cholesterol. 
• Trans fat lowers HDL (good) cholesterol. 

================================================================================
• Trans fat increases blood triglycerides. 
• Trans fat decreases insulin sensitivity. 
• Trans fat increases insulin response to glucose. 
• Trans fat hampers immune system function. 
• Trans fat interferes with your liver‘s detoxification processes. 
• Trans fat may cause cancer. 
• Trans fat can increase risk of type 2 diabetes. 
• Trans fat causes inflammation in the body. 
• Trans fat interferes with EFA functions. 
• Trans fat makes your platelets stickier. 
WHAT THE LEANEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD DO 
Most mainstream medical, health, and nutrition organizations have published position statements with 
similar opinions on dietary fat intake. For good health and weight control, the most common 
recommendation is to keep your dietary fat intake between 20 percent and 35 percent of total calories. 
When it comes to dietary fat, physique athletes follow the conventional wisdom fairly closely, 
though they tend to stay on the lower end of the range. That leaves them more room for lean protein 
and natural carbs. They‘re also meticulous about choosing the highest-quality fats with the most 
nutritional value. Based on my research and real-world experience with physique athletes, I‘ve found 
that most people get the best results with about 20 percent of their daily calories from fat. 
You may need to adjust for your goals and experiment to see what suits your body type the best. 
Naturally, people who are carb intolerant fare better on fewer carbs and more fat. If you use a reduced-
carb approach for accelerated fat loss, a slightly higher fat intake often makes sense. Some people 
report more energy or less hunger with a slight bump in fat. Others have a personal preference in one 
direction or the other and they find it helps them stick to their meal plan better. If you choose your fats 
carefully, there‘s no reason you couldn‘t take your fat intake to 25 percent to 30 percent of your total 
calories and you‘d still be in the range. 
On a practical level, hitting these numbers means you‘ll need to check your meal plans and make 
sure you‘ve included some fats every day. If you‘re accustomed to nonfat diets or you prefer low-fat 
foods in general, sometimes you have go out of your way to add fat back in alongside your lean 
proteins and natural complex carbs. That could be as easy as taking an EFA supplement. It could also 
include adding fatty fish to your meal plans, making recipes with extra virgin olive oil, having a whole 
egg or two, stirring flaxseed into your oatmeal, putting avocado in your salads, snacking on a handful 
of nuts, or eating a tablespoon of natural peanut butter. 
Nonfat and very low-fat diets are not the answer for maximizing fat loss or muscle growth. High-fat 
diets are not the answer either. If you eat a moderate amount of fat, and you eat the right kinds of fats, 
then you‘ll be on your way to a body that‘s healthy, muscular, and lean. 
In the next chapter, you‘ll learn about the macronutrient that fitness enthusiasts, bodybuilders, 
athletes, and almost anyone who has ever hit the gym is more fascinated by and concerned with than 
any other: protein! 
BURN THE FAT, FEED THE MUSCLE ACTION SUMMARY: FAT 

================================================================================
• Aim for 20 percent to 30 percent of your total calories from fat. 
• Eat fatty fish such as salmon, trout, mackerel, sardines, and herring at least two or three times a 
week. 
• Eat nuts and seeds, provided you stay within your calorie limits (nuts are healthy but calorie 
dense). 
• Eat avocados and olives, provided you stay within your calorie limits. 
• Reduce fats in general to help you control your calories during deficit eating. 
• Use an essential fatty acid supplement such as flaxseed oil or fish oil if you don‘t get enough 
healthy fats from whole foods. 
• Avoid trans fats, including foods with ―hydrogenated‖ on the label. 
• Avoid any foods that are deep-fried in oil. 
QUICK START 
Getting enough good fats and avoiding the bad fats is easy! All you have to do is follow the eight

CHAPTER 10 
Protein, the Muscle Builder 
and Metabolic Stimulator 
Individuals habitually performing resistance or endurance exercise require more protein than their 
sedentary counterparts…[H]igher protein diets have consistently been shown to result in greater 
weight loss, greater fat loss, and preservation of lean mass as compared with ―lower‖ protein diets. 
—Dr. Stuart Phillips, Exercise Metabolism Research Group, Department of Kinesiology, 
McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario 
WHY YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT—LITERALLY 
Heraclitus, the Greek philosopher, said, ―You cannot step in the same river twice.‖ A river may look 
the same every day, but it isn‘t the same because of the never-ending flow of new water running 
through it. The same is true of the human body. Although your body appears solid, it‘s in a constant 
state of flux as old cells die and new ones replace them. 
You are continually replacing old blood cells with new ones. Every month you produce a new skin 
as dead cells are shed and new cells grow underneath. Parts of your skeleton are completely 
remodeled every four months. Every six weeks, all the cells are replaced in your liver. You have a 
new stomach lining every five days. The proteins in your muscles are continually turned over as old 
tissue is broken down and new tissue is synthesized. Every cell in your body is constantly being 
recycled. 
From a molecular point of view, you‘re not the same person you were a year ago. It makes you 
realize that the maxim ―You are what you eat‖ can and should be taken literally. Once you‘ve grasped 
this concept, it makes you think twice about what you feed your body every day. 
PROTEIN: THE RAW BUILDING MATERIAL FOR THE BODY 
If your body is constantly creating new cells, the question is: Where do all these new cells come from? 
The answer, of course, is: from your food—specifically, protein foods. Proteins play many roles in 
your body. They serve as enzymes, hormones, antibodies, and nutrient transporters. But proteins are 
best known for their structural functions: They are literally the raw construction material for body 
cells as bricks are for a building. 
Body structures made from protein include skin, hair, nails, bones, connective tissue, and, of course, 
muscle. Next to water, protein is the most abundant substance in your body, making up approximately 
15 percent of your weight. Of most interest to those who want a better physique is that 65 percent of 
all the protein in your body is located in your skeletal muscles. 
AMINO ACIDS: THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PROTEIN 

================================================================================
The smallest units of a protein are called amino acids. Just as glycogen is formed from the linkage of 
glucose molecules, proteins are formed from the joining of numerous amino acids. Bricks are building 
material that can be cemented together into a nearly unlimited number of structures, such as a brick 
house, a brick wall, a brick road, and a brick chimney. In the same way, your body takes individual 
amino acids and ―cements‖ them together with peptide bonds into various configurations to create 
muscle tissue and other body proteins. 
There are 20 amino acids the human body requires for growth. From these 20 amino acids, tens of 
thousands of different protein molecules can be formed. Each protein is assembled from the bonding 
of different amino acids into various configurations. Growth hormone, for example, is a protein chain 
of 156 amino acids. The muscle protein myosin is formed from the linkage of 4,500 amino acid units. 
ESSENTIAL VERSUS NONESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS 
Of the 20 amino acids, your body can make 11. These are called the nonessential amino acids (also 
known as dispensable amino acids). The other nine amino acids are called essential amino acids (or 
indispensable amino acids). Essential amino acids are those that can‘t be manufactured by your body 
and must be supplied from your food. 
Essential (Indispensable) Amino Acids 
Nonessential (Dispensable) Amino Acids 
Histidine 
Alanine 
Isoleucine* 
Arginine 
Leucine* 
Asparagine 
Lysine 
Aspartic acid 
Methionine 
Cysteine 
Phenylalanine 
Glutamic acid 
Threonine 
Glutamine* 
Tryptophan 
Glycine 
Valine* 
Proline 
  
Serine 
  
Tyrosine 
*Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are known as branched chain amino acids, or BCAAs, which are metabolized mostly in muscle and play 
an important role in protein synthesis. Glutamine is known as a conditionally essential amino acid because under conditions of stress or 
trauma, you may require more of it than your body can produce. 
WHY YOU MUST EAT COMPLETE PROTEINS EVERY DAY 

================================================================================
Foods that contain all the essential and nonessential amino acids in the exact ratio and amounts 
required by your body for growth are called complete proteins. For your body to synthesize muscle, all 
the essential amino acids must be available simultaneously. Any nonessential amino acids that are in 
short supply can be produced by your liver, but if an essential amino acid is missing, your body must 
break down its own proteins to obtain it. 
Proteins can‘t be stored to any significant degree. There‘s only a very small and transient amino 
acid pool in the blood and tissues, making up only about 1 percent of all the protein in your body. To 
maintain the ideal environment for muscle growth and prevent muscle breakdown, complete proteins 
must be eaten every day, and ideally with every meal. 
Protein has the highest thermic effect of all the macronutrients. Up to 30 percent of the calories are 
burned off to digest and absorb the protein. The thermic effect of carbohydrates is 10 percent or less, 
so replacing a portion of your carb calories with protein gives you a metabolic advantage. High-
quality complete proteins such as chicken, beef, fish, eggs, and dairy products increase that advantage 
even more than low-biological-value proteins like beans or wheat. One study published in the 
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that the number of calories burned was 2 percent higher 
when the subjects got their protein mostly from meat rather than soy. 
PROTEIN QUALITY: COMPLETE VERSUS INCOMPLETE 
PROTEINS 
Protein quality refers to how well your body can digest and utilize a particular protein. 
Scientists have many ways to rate protein quality, such as testing for biological value, protein 
efficiency ratio, or protein digestibility. The important thing for you to know is that the highest-quality 
proteins come from animal sources such as milk, eggs, fish, and meat. These are complete proteins 
that contain all the essential amino acids in the exact amounts and proportions your body needs. 
ARE PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS BETTER THAN PROTEIN FOODS? 
The protein industry is large and lucrative, so the advertisements make protein drinks seem like 
muscle-building miracles. But protein supplements—powders, ready-to-drink shakes, and pills (amino 
acids)—are not better than whole foods and they‘re not mandatory. If you get enough protein from 
whole food sources, there‘s no need for a supplement. If you often fall short of your daily protein goal 
from food, then supplements can be helpful. 
One real advantage is convenience. When you‘re busy, instead of a sit-down meal that takes time 
for food prep and cooking, you could whip up a high-protein meal-replacement shake and it only takes 
minutes. If you learn some tasty smoothie recipes, that might even make your meal plans more 
enjoyable and easier to follow. You can use straight protein powder in whole-food recipes too. For 
example, you could stir vanilla whey protein in your oatmeal and add a pinch of cinnamon, and you 
have a delicious three-minute breakfast. Try chocolate whey protein mixed in plain Greek yogurt with 
1 tablespoon of natural peanut butter and you have a two-minute snack that tastes like dessert. 
Remember that the human body was not designed to process liquids all day long; it was designed to 
digest food. Whole foods contain biologically active nutrients that interact with one another in the 
whole-food matrix and in our bodies in ways that isolated nutrients do not. Use protein supplements 
occasionally as you see fit, but focus on whole foods first. 
Complete Lean Protein Foods 

================================================================================
✓ Eggs (whites and whole eggs) 
✓ Dairy products (low- or nonfat milk, cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt) 
✓ Milk, egg, casein, and whey protein powders 
✓ Lean beef 
✓ Bison, venison, and other game meats 
✓ Chicken breast 
✓ Turkey breast 
✓ Lean pork (tenderloin) 
✓ Fish 
✓ Shellfish 
One issue with animal proteins is that many of them also contain large amounts of calories and 
saturated fat. If you want to control calories, reduce the amount of animal fats you consume by going 
with the leaner proteins. This is easy to do by choosing lean meats such as turkey and chicken breast, 
only the leanest cuts of red meat (top round, lean sirloin, bison, or game meats), egg whites (instead of 
only whole eggs), and low-fat or nonfat dairy products instead of whole-milk dairy products. 
Many vegetables, beans, nuts, legumes, grains, and other plant-based foods contain substantial 
amounts of protein, and it all counts toward your total daily protein goal. However, the protein in these 
foods is usually not considered complete because it‘s low in one or more of the essential amino acids 
(known as a limiting amino acid). Beans, for example, are high in protein with about 15 grams per 
cup. However, they are low in the essential amino acid methionine. Grains lack the essential amino 
acid lysine. 
In general, proteins from plant sources are lower in quality and digestibility. However, combining 
two incomplete sources of plant-based protein gives you all the amino acids you need to build muscle. 
Complementary protein combinations such as rice and beans are how vegetarians can improve their 
overall daily protein quality. It‘s not mandatory to eat a lot of animal proteins to get lean and 
muscular, but it is mandatory to eat complete proteins and meet your total protein requirement every 
day. 
CAN A VEGETARIAN FOLLOW BURN THE FAT, FEED THE 
MUSCLE? 
Yes. This program can easily be adapted for lacto-, ovo-, or pesco-vegetarians. There‘s no doubt that 
vegetarians who eat dairy products, eggs, or fish can build great physiques. Meat is a favorite 
bodybuilder‘s food, but it‘s not mandatory. Bill Pearl was well-known for giving up red meat, but he 
did get complete proteins from eggs and dairy products. With his semivegetarian approach, Pearl won 
the Mr. America and Mr. Universe titles and became a legend in the bodybuilding and fitness world. 
What about vegans? Yes, even people who eat no animal products at all can achieve low body fat 
levels and sculpt highly fit physiques. However, this more restricted approach does require greater 
attention to make sure calorie, amino acid, and nutrient needs are met. Without including at least some 
complete proteins in the form of eggs, dairy, fish, or milk-based protein powders, vegans may find 
their muscular development falling short of their maximum potential. 
A vegan having a hard time hitting the minimum protein targets could supplement with vegetarian 
protein powders such as soy, pea, rice, and hemp (hemp contains not only plant protein, but also fiber 

================================================================================
and valuable omega-3 fats). Exercise physiologists William D. McArdle, Frank I. Katch, and Victor L. 
Katch, the authors of Sports and Exercise Nutrition, suggest that vegetarians could also benefit by 
increasing their total protein intake by 10 percent above standard recommendations to adjust for the 
less efficient digestion and lower quality of plant proteins. 
SHOULD YOU EAT SOY PROTEIN? 
Among the plant-based proteins, soybeans have a respectable amino acid profile (some soy isolate 
supplements are even fortified with methionine), although soy is only 78 percent digestible, whereas 
milk and egg proteins are 97 percent digestible. Soy is promoted for lowering cholesterol and reducing 
symptoms of menopause, but at the same time criticized for negative effects. Soy contains plant 
chemicals called phytoestrogens, a concern for men who worry about feminizing effects. 
The health pros and cons are still being debated, but a small amount of soy protein shouldn‘t have 
any major downsides, even for men. However, unless you‘re allergic or intolerant to milk products or 
you‘re a vegetarian, there‘s little reason to depend on soy as a major protein source when your goal is 
more muscle and less fat. Recent research shows that the milk proteins, whey and casein, are superior 
to soy for stimulating protein synthesis, and research on soy foods and weight loss says there‘s no 
difference either way. 
HOW MUCH PROTEIN: WHAT THE LEANEST PEOPLE IN THE 
WORLD DO 
The recommended daily intakes (RDIs) are the official government nutrition guidelines from the 
National Research Council. The RDI for protein is based on total body weight and is set at 0.8 grams 
per kilogram of body weight (0.36 grams per pound of body weight). For a 172-pound person, that‘s 
only 62 grams per day. Many traditional nutritionists say this paltry amount is enough for everyone. 
Bodybuilders and fitness athletes say it‘s not even close to being enough, because the RDI was 
developed for the average sedentary person to avoid deficiency, not for people training hard to burn 
fat and build muscle. Minimum and optimum protein levels are two different numbers. Among the 
leanest, most muscular people in the world, 1 gram per pound of body weight per day has been a rule 
of thumb for years. The science suggests they‘re right. 
Dr. Peter Lemon, director of the exercise nutrition research laboratory at the University of Western 
Ontario, has been studying protein requirements since the 1980s. His research indicates that strength 
athletes not using anabolic drugs need approximately 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight 
just to maintain an anabolic state. To support new muscle growth, Dr. Lemon said, ―Certainly in the 
range of 0.9 grams per pound of body weight is where to start, though optimal intakes might be 
higher.‖ If we add a little margin for safety, that‘s right in line with the bodybuilder‘s 1-gram-per-
pound rule. 
QUICK START 
Eat a high-quality protein food (lean meat, fish, eggs or dairy products) with every meal and aim 
for approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day, and your protein 
nutrition will be covered! 

================================================================================
DOUBLE-CHECK TO BE SURE YOU MEET YOUR DAILY PROTEIN 
QUOTA 
The macronutrient percentage method is an easy way to set up your meal plans by the numbers and 
figure out how many grams of carbs, protein, and fat to eat. If you do your calorie calculations 
properly and choose the right percentages—which you learned how to do in previous chapters—you 
should automatically land within the ideal range for grams of protein. 
Example 1: 
YOU ARE A FEMALE, 130 POUNDS, VERY ACTIVE. 
Your optimal calorie intake to lose fat is 1,700 calories per day. 
To determine your protein intake, multiply your caloric intake by 30 percent. 
1,700 calories per day × 0.30 = 510 calories from protein 
510 protein calories ÷ 4 calories per gram of protein = 127.5 grams of protein 
Example 2: 
YOU ARE MALE, 190 POUNDS, MODERATELY ACTIVE. 
Your optimal calorie intake to lose fat is 2,600 calories per day. 
To determine your protein intake, multiply your caloric intake by 30 percent. 
2,600 calories per day × 0.30 = 780 calories from protein 
780 protein calories ÷ 4 calories per gram of protein = 195 grams of protein 
If you set your protein at 30 percent of your total calories, that usually comes very close to the 1-
gram-per-pound-of-body-weight rule. However, getting enough protein is so important for achieving 
your body composition goals, you should double-check your protein intake in grams to be sure you 
don‘t underestimate. Sometimes, you may need to bump your protein to a higher percentage of 
calories to hit your gram quota. 
On the other hand, if someone is overweight, with high body fat, the 1-gram-per-pound-of-body-
weight rule may overestimate protein needs. A 250-pound woman with 35 percent body fat doesn‘t 
need 250 grams of protein: Extra protein isn‘t required to support extra body fat tissue. In this case, 
she could use one gram per pound of lean body weight, which would be only 162 grams of protein. 
For men over 20 percent body fat and women over 30 percent body fat, I‘d recommend checking your 
daily protein quota in grams per pound of lean body weight. 
In some special cases, there may be advantages to eating even more protein than one gram per 
pound. These include: 
1.  When your goal is gaining muscle and your training is demanding 
2.  When your goal is getting lean and your calories or carbs are low 
PROTEIN INTAKE AND GAINING MUSCLE 

================================================================================
To gain lean body weight, you must increase your calories into a surplus. A 190-pound male with a 
3,000-calorie maintenance level needs a surplus of approximately 15 percent. That‘s an extra 450 
calories, for a total of 3,450 calories a day. Thirty percent of that is 1,035 protein calories or 258 
grams of protein a day. That‘s a lot of protein—more than 1.3 grams per pound of body weight. Is it 
too much? 
In the Journal of Sports Sciences, protein researcher Dr. Kevin D. Tipton speculated that protein 
intakes as high as 1.1 to 1.4 grams per pound of body weight might be the best recommendation when 
the goal is muscle growth and training is demanding. If that‘s more than the muscles can use for 
growth, the excess will simply be oxidized. As long as other important nutrients aren‘t displaced, at 
the very least, eating more protein won‘t hurt. 
There‘s not enough evidence to say for sure whether more than one gram per pound of body weight 
will increase muscle growth. Most of the research we have is the in-the-trenches kind from the 
experience of bodybuilders and fitness athletes. Also, extra protein alone doesn‘t guarantee more 
muscle. It takes adequate protein, surplus calories, and progressive weight training—combined with 
proper recovery—to stimulate muscle growth. 
So why eat more protein? If your goal changes from burning fat to gaining muscle, you‘re going to 
need a lot more calories. Those surplus calories have to come from somewhere. The alternative is to 
eat more fat and carbs. If you go overboard with any food, the excess can be stored as fat. But in a 
surplus, dietary fat is the macronutrient most likely to be converted into body fat first. Carbs and fat 
are also a lot easier to overeat. All things considered, when you increase your calories to gain muscle, 
it‘s reasonable to raise your protein along with your calories. 
PROTEIN INTAKE AND LOW-CALORIE/LOW-CARB DIETING 
If your goal is to get super-lean, show off six-pack abs, achieve fat loss at the fastest rate possible, or 
break a fat-loss plateau, you‘ll sometimes get more aggressive with your calorie cuts or carb 
restrictions. If you want to burn more fat, one way or the other, your calorie deficit must increase. 
However, your protein requirement does not decrease. If anything, as your calorie intake goes down, 
your protein needs go up. That‘s why it makes so much sense to increase a deficit by cutting carb 
calories specifically and leaving that precious protein intake high. 
You could simply cut all calories across the board, and as the law of energy balance dictates, you‘ll 
still lose weight. But if you hold the protein steady, or even increase the protein, it‘s more likely that 
all the weight you lose will be fat. Maintaining muscle isn‘t the only advantage: Protein also 
suppresses hunger and increases metabolism more than any other macronutrient. That makes three 
major advantages to keeping protein high when calories are low. 
Most people pursuing advanced fat-loss goals will optimize their results by getting about 40 percent 
of their calories from protein. This usually falls in the 1.1- to 1.3-grams-per-pound-of-body-weight 
range. By definition, this is a high-protein intake, which is more than enough to give all the fat-loss 
advantages. Bodybuilders in serious training and in a calorie deficit are known to take in as much as 
1.4 to 1.5 grams per pound of body weight. When they‘re training for fat loss and their deficit is 
aggressive, that can sometimes be as much as 45 percent to 50 percent of total calories—a very high 
protein ratio. 
Not surprisingly, many mainstream nutritionists question whether it‘s necessary to eat so much 
protein if the excess simply gets converted into glucose and burned off. Bodybuilders argue that even 
if it does, it isn‘t a bad thing. Metabolizing protein burns calories, so physique athletes consider this a 
slight edge in achieving the ripped look. 

================================================================================
In that sense, you could say that a high-protein diet is not only a muscle builder, it‘s also a 
metabolic stimulator. The metabolism advantage may be small, but when combined with the hunger-
reducing and muscle-preserving effects, a higher protein intake beats lower protein for fat loss every 
time. 
HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU EAT PROTEIN? 
There are two high-priority protein goals in Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle. The first and most 
important is to hit your total daily protein target, including high-quality proteins that supply all the 
essential amino acids. The second is to eat protein with every meal. 
When you eat protein is not as important as hitting your total daily quota, but scientists say there‘s 
evidence that spreading your daily protein intake over several meals helps optimize muscle growth. 
Protein also helps control hunger, so there are benefits on both the fat-burning and the muscle-building 
sides. 
Donald K. Layman, PhD, a protein researcher from the University of Illinois, says that the average 
American eats over 65 percent of his daily protein in a single large dinner meal, leaving less than 35 
percent distributed among the other meals (as little as 10 grams or less at breakfast). In his research 
papers on protein metabolism, he points out that this meal pattern is not optimal for a variety of 
reasons. ―Vitamins and minerals can fulfill nutrient needs on a once-per-day-basis, but for protein, the 
body has no ability to store a daily supply.… To stimulate protein synthesis, adults need at least 25–30 
grams of protein and at least 2.5 grams of (the BCAA) leucine per meal.… Dietary patterns that 
provide adequate protein at only one meal produce an anabolic response only after that meal.‖ 
Among bodybuilders and fitness athletes, eating four to six times per day has always been the best 
practice and that‘s the model we follow. In Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, our baseline plan has you 
eating five times per day. If it‘s feasible, eat a protein at every one of those meals or snacks. At the 
minimum, eat protein three or four times per day if you want to optimize the muscle-building 
response. This also makes it easier to hit your daily protein goal without overloading your stomach all 
at once. 
There‘s no reason you can‘t eat more in one sitting: Your body will still digest a big steak with 60 
grams of protein. But there‘s no point to eating more protein at one meal, hoping it will turn into more 
muscle. The research shows that protein synthesis caps out around 30 or 40 grams and that spreading 
out your protein is better. If you spread the protein evenly, it usually averages out to about 25 to 30 
grams per meal for women and 35 to 40 grams per meal for men during fat-loss programs (maybe a 
little more for big, tall, or highly active people). 
SOME FINAL THOUGHTS ON PROTEIN RULES 
It‘s impossible to set carved-in-stone rules about protein intake. Protein needs vary from person to 
person based on goals, body size, training intensity, caloric intake, and whether the goal is burning, 
building, or maintaining. The range of recommended intakes is very broad, which is good, because it 
gives you plenty of room to customize and you don‘t have to worry about hitting one number as long 
as you‘re in the acceptable ranges. 
That said, the 1-gram-per-pound-of-body-weight rule is a no-brainer guideline for any healthy 
person doing resistance training and pursuing fat loss. The low end of the range is around 0.8 to 0.9 
grams per pound. Some strength or physique athletes doing intense training or serious dieting might 
get optimal results with as much as 1.1 to 1.4 grams or more. 

================================================================================
This doesn‘t mean you should try to duplicate Mr. Olympia‘s meal plan or go crazy and eat as much 
protein as you can. Too much of any food will get converted into fat, including protein. Too much of 
any nutrient can also be unhealthy, especially if it pushes out other important nutrients. But when you 
weigh all the evidence, from the viewpoint of getting leaner and more muscular, it‘s better to err on 
the side of too much protein than too little. 
There‘s a final macronutrient to talk about—one that‘s even more controversial than protein. 
Carbohydrates! Are carbs your friends or your foes? You‘ll find out in the next chapter. 
BURN THE FAT, FEED THE MUSCLE ACTION SUMMARY: 
PROTEIN 
• Aim for a daily protein target of 1 gram per pound of body weight, give or take 0.1 to 0.2 grams. 
• As a baseline, set up your meal plans with approximately 30 percent of total calories from protein. 
• When your calorie deficit is aggressive, you may increase your protein to approximately 40 
percent of total calories or 1.1 to 1.3 grams per pound of body weight. 
• If you‘re in serious training for muscle growth, you may (optionally) increase your protein to or 
above 1.1 to 1.4 grams per pound of body weight. 
• Eat a high-quality complete protein with every meal. 
• Aim for about 25 to 40 grams of protein per meal: women and smaller individuals toward the 
lower end of the range, men and larger individuals toward the higher end. 
• Eat protein before and after your weight training workouts.

CHAPTER 11 
Clearing Up Carbohydrate Confusion 
Carbohydrates get a bad rap. Eat carbs. Enjoy them. In fact, ―earn‖ more of them through exercise. 
The more you exercise, the more carbs your body will use. And eat most of your carbs from colorful 
fruits and veggies. When you do eat grain-based foods, focus on fiber! 
—Chris Mohr, PhD, RD, founder of MohrResults.com 
PINPOINTING THE PERFECT CARBOHYDRATE INTAKE 
In previous chapters, you learned that extreme diets, including extremely low- or high-carb diets, are 
not the best way to get lean and stay lean. That leaves a lot of room in the middle. In this chapter, I‘ll 
help you narrow this gap and pinpoint the perfect carbohydrate intake for you based on your goals, 
your training, and your body type. 
You‘ll also learn about the different classes of carbs, including which ones are best for energy, 
health, and fat loss. You‘ll discover that some carbs are healthful and some are harmful. You‘ll find 
how to distinguish processed from natural carbs, fibrous from starchy carbs, and simple from complex 
carbs. You‘ll read about the dangers of refined carbs and the virtues of natural carbs as well as the 
difference between calorie-dense and nutrient-dense carbs. 
To shed fat, build muscle, optimize your health, and increase your energy, the key is to learn the 
differences between the categories of carbs, choose the right types, and eat them in the right amounts 
at the right times. This plan shows you how. 
CARBS: PREMIUM FUEL FOR BODY AND BRAIN 
Unlike proteins, which are used as building materials, carbs are used for energy. Sports nutritionist Dr. 
Michael Colgan calls carbs ―premium fuel.‖ I‘ve never heard a better definition. Protein can be broken 
down into glucose and used for fuel, but that‘s an inefficient process, and you never want to sacrifice 
your muscle protein. Fats are also used for fuel, but even fats don‘t burn as efficiently as carbs. 
It‘s a common misconception that fat is a more efficient fuel. It‘s not; it‘s simply a more 
concentrated fuel (nine calories per gram for fat versus four calories per gram for carbs). Carbs are 
your body‘s preferred and most efficient energy source for intense training. Scientists tell us that, 
under normal conditions, your brain needs 100 to 130 grams of glucose per day. If you cut carbs too 
much, your physical performance and even your mental sharpness usually take a nosedive. 
Fat is stored in your body as a backup energy source. A 135-pound woman with 25 percent body fat 
has 118,125 calories stored in her ―reserve fuel tank.‖ Your body can also store carbs (as glycogen), 
but in much more limited quantities. About 1,600 calories of glycogen can be stored in your muscles 
and approximately 400 calories in your liver. 
Your body is always burning a mixture of carbs and fat for fuel, but the fuel mix changes based on 
demand. During low-intensity, long-duration exercise, most of your energy comes from fat. Most of 

================================================================================
your energy also comes from fat while you‘re at rest. During shorter bouts of high-intensity exercise, 
such as sprinting or weight lifting, carbs are the main fuel. 
Your primary energy source can also change depending on which fuel is more readily available. If 
carbs are restricted, your body can easily use fat for fuel. However, carbs are the limiting factor in 
exercise performance. Intense exercise burns up muscle glycogen quickly, and if you fail to replace it 
by eating enough carbs, you ―hit the wall,‖ or ―bonk,‖ as athletes like to say. Within about three days 
of a severe carb cutback, your muscle glycogen will be significantly depleted. Reducing carbs may 
make fat loss easier, but since cardio and weight training are such important elements of Burn the Fat, 
Feed the Muscle, cutting carbs completely is not recommended. 
Ultimately, all the carbs you eat end up in your bloodstream as glucose (blood sugar), but you can‘t 
lump all carbs together into one category, because they‘re not all the same. Some carbs are good and 
some are bad. The good carbs are your friends: they supply you with energy and nutrients and help 
you get leaner and more muscular. The bad carbs are your foes; they have a greater propensity for fat 
storage, contribute to health problems, and are nutritionally empty. 
SIMPLE CARBS 
Structurally speaking, there are two broad categories of carbs: simple and complex. Simple carbs 
consist of a single sugar molecule (monosaccharide) or two sugar molecules linked together 
(disaccharide). 
Monosaccharides include fructose, glucose, and galactose. The two you hear about the most are 
fructose and glucose. Glucose is found naturally in food or your body can produce it by breaking 
down complex carbs. Fructose is the type of simple carb found in fruit. 
Disaccharides are formed by the combination of two monosaccharide molecules. Examples include 
sucrose (table sugar), which is formed by the combination of fructose and glucose, and lactose (dairy 
sugar), which is composed of galactose and glucose. 
In general, simple carbs are digested quickly and cause a rapid rise in blood sugar, especially when 
you eat a lot of them alone or in meals with no fat, fiber, or protein. When there‘s a blood sugar spike, 
there‘s a large release of insulin from the pancreas. The insulin quickly clears the sugar from the 
bloodstream, leading to a blood sugar dip known as hypoglycemia. You probably recognize low blood 
sugar by its common symptoms: low energy, shakiness, weakness, mood swings, and hunger. The 
hunger leads you back to more sugar and perpetuates a vicious cycle of ups and downs throughout the 
day. 
When you hear about simple carbs, you usually think about white sugar and white flour products. 
These processed carbs are well-known as the ―bad‖ kind. They‘re the ones that cause your blood sugar 
to spike and crash; they come with lots of calories but no nutrition, and they contribute to obesity, 
diabetes, and other diseases. But not all simple carbs are bad for you. Foods that contain natural sugars 
are fine if you eat them in balance with the other macronutrients and stay inside your calorie limits. 
Some of them are very nutritious and actually help you lose fat. 
IS FRUCTOSE REALLY FATTENING? 
Fructose, the natural sugar in fruit, has been wrongly accused as a bad guy to the point of alarmism. 
Many people claim that fructose is fattening and unhealthy but they don‘t distinguish between the 
natural fructose in fruit and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). HFCS is a refined sugar used to sweeten 

================================================================================
soft drinks and other processed foods. It delivers large amounts of calories with no nutritional value. 
Fruit is a natural, nutritious, low-calorie whole food. 
Another reason for the ―fruit-is-fattening‖ myth is because fructose is processed differently in the 
body than other carbs and most people misunderstand how that works. Fructose restores liver 
glycogen preferentially over muscle glycogen and your liver has a limited storage capacity. Beyond 
about 50 grams daily, fructose can be converted to fatty acids. But a typical piece of fruit has only 
about 5 to 10 grams of fructose. At that dose, it would take a huge amount of whole fruit for any 
conversion of fructose into fat. 
On the other hand, you could easily hit 50 grams of fructose in a day if you drink soda or other 
drinks sweetened with HFCS or sucrose (which is 50 percent fructose). Just two 12-ounce soft drinks 
can provide up to 50 grams and 200 calories of fructose. 
Health and fitness professionals have always urged people to eat more fruits and vegetables, but 
between 1970 and 1997, intake increased by only 19 percent, providing a mere 2.5 grams per day 
increase in naturally occurring fructose. During the same time frame, HFCS consumption increased by 
26 percent per capita, from 64 grams per day to 81 grams per day, an average daily intake of 324 
calories from added fructose. Clearly, refined sugars and too many calories are the real problems, not 
natural sugars. 
EVIDENCE THAT WHOLE FRUIT HELPS WITH FAT LOSS 
Ironically, amidst all the fructose fears, there‘s evidence that fruit actually helps with fat loss. Studies 
from the University of Navarra in Spain examined the effect of fruit on both health and weight loss. 
One group of women ate a hypocaloric diet with 5 percent fructose from fruit, while a second group 
ate a hypocaloric diet with 15 percent fructose from fruit. There were no differences in weight loss. 
However, the higher fruit group retained more lean body mass. In the group with the higher fruit 
intake, LDL (bad) cholesterol decreased and there was less oxidative stress. 
Whole fruit is a healthy food because it contains vitamins and minerals as well as carotenoids, 
flavonoids, and polyphenols, which are natural compounds with health-promoting properties. Most 
fruits also have a low calorie density. This comes from the high fiber and high water content, a 
combination also known to increase the feeling of fullness after a meal. Fruits also contain fiber, and 
some, such as raspberries, are extremely high in fiber. 
Like many ambitious bodybuilders, I cut fruit from my precontest diets in the early days of my 
career because the diet gurus told me to. I got super-lean. I later put the fruit back in moderate 
amounts (one or two pieces every day). There was no difference: I still got super lean. The research 
confirms my experience, but to this day, certain corners of the fitness community still can‘t shake the 
stigma that fruit is fattening. 
For physique athletes heading toward single-digit body fat, every little bit counts, so many 
bodybuilding and figure competitors still choose to minimize fruit even if it‘s just to make room for 
more fibrous vegetables and lean proteins. The idea of limiting fruit for fat loss also appears often in 
the low-carb community. But don‘t misconstrue any of this as meaning that ―fruit is fattening.‖ 
The bottom line: Whole, fresh fruit is not the bad guy; it‘s an innocent casualty of bodybuilding 
tradition, low-carb dogma, and misunderstanding of human physiology. If you‘re eating fruit while 
consistently staying in a calorie deficit, you‘re going to lose body fat and gain health benefits. High-
fructose corn syrup and added sugars, on the other hand, deserve the bad rap and should be avoided. 

================================================================================
LACTOSE AND DAIRY PRODUCTS: DO THEY BELONG IN A 
HEALTHY FAT-BURNING PROGRAM? 
Dairy products contain protein and carbs. Lactose is the natural sugar found in dairy products. In 
recent years, dairy products have become almost as controversial as fructose. Some people wonder 
whether dairy products are fattening. Others are concerned that milk products might be unhealthy. 
Physique athletes and others who want extremely low body fat have traditionally removed the dairy 
from their diets, at least before competitions or photo shoots. Some bodybuilders believe that dairy 
products are more easily converted to body fat because of the simple sugars they contain. Many swear 
that dropping dairy from their diets gets rid of bloating and puffiness, revealing more muscle 
definition. It might make a difference at the competition level, but calorie for calorie, there‘s no reason 
to believe that lactose or dairy products are more fattening than other types of carbs. 
What‘s most likely to undermine fat loss is the high-calorie density of full-fat dairy products. Full-
fat cheeses for example, can add an enormous number of calories to your meals. There‘s an easy 
solution: Use low-fat or nonfat versions of cheese, milk, cottage cheese, and yogurt. Some people 
consider store-bought milk to be a processed food or they worry about hormones and antibiotics. If 
these are concerns for you, there‘s a solution for that as well: Choose organic. 
As long as your digestive system can handle it, dairy products can be a part of any fat-loss program. 
They add variety and flavor to your meal plans while giving you another superb source of high-
biological-value protein in addition to your lean meat, fish, and eggs. Vitamin D and calcium are 
bonuses. 
Not everyone can stomach dairy products. People with lactose intolerance don‘t have the enzyme 
necessary to digest lactose, so they experience gas, bloating, abdominal cramps, or diarrhea when they 
eat certain dairy products. In those with minor intolerance, the symptoms can be subtle. Those with 
severe intolerance pay the price if they as much as touch the stuff. Products like Lactaid may help, but 
if you‘re one of the many who can‘t drink milk or eat dairy products, don‘t worry: This program 
works with or without dairy. It‘s your choice. 
COMPLEX CARBS: FIBROUS VERSUS STARCHY 
The second major carb category is complex carbs, also known as polysaccharides. Most complex 
carbs contain fiber and they provide sustained energy without the highs and lows you get after eating 
simple carbs. They‘re usually more filling as well, making you feel more satisfied on less food. 
Complex carbs from natural sources are also more nutrient dense, whereas simple carbs from refined 
sources are nutritionally void. Complex carbs include grains, starchy vegetables, and fibrous 
vegetables. 
Starch is the storage form of energy in plants. Starchy carbs include potatoes, yams, cereals, grains, 
bread, pasta, rice, oats, wheat, legumes, and beans. Your body is able to completely absorb and digest 
all the caloric energy in starches, so starchy carbs are more calorie dense than fibrous carbs. 
Fiber is the indigestible portion of the plant, so it passes through your digestive tract without all the 
caloric energy being absorbed. Fiber gives bulk to the intestinal contents, promotes healthy digestion 
and elimination, speeds the transit time of food through your digestive tract, and protects you from 
gastrointestinal diseases and colon cancer. You could say that fiber is ―nature‘s internal cleanser.‖ 
A study from Tufts University said that in the United States, the average fiber intake is only 15 
grams per day. Most dieticians and health organizations recommend about 25 to 35 grams per day. A 
customized fiber formula was published by researchers at the University of Kentucky in the journal 
Nutrition Reviews. They recommended 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories per day of energy 

================================================================================
expenditure. For a female at 2,100 calories of TDEE per day, this is 29 grams of fiber. For a male at 
2,800 calories of TDEE, it‘s 39 grams of fiber per day. 
Some people think that a program high in protein must be low in fiber, but that‘s not true with Burn 
the Fat, Feed the Muscle. You eat optimal amounts and sometimes high amounts of lean protein on 
this plan, but you also eat lots of greens and fibrous vegetables. The combination of fibrous carbs with 
lean protein is what makes this program so healthy in addition to being so effective for reducing 
hunger and burning fat. 
You won‘t even have to count grams of fiber, unless you want to, because simply following the 
meal plan template (in Chapter 14) and including the fruits and vegetables with each meal will 
automatically assure you of getting optimal amounts of fiber. 
HOW FIBROUS CARBS HELP YOU BURN MORE FAT 
Fiber can also help with fat loss. Fibrous foods take more time to chew and swallow, add bulk to your 
meals (filling up your stomach), slow down gastric emptying, and may even decrease appetite-
stimulating hormones. The big advantage of fibrous carbs such as leafy greens and other nonstarchy 
vegetables is the low calorie density. It‘s nearly impossible to overeat green vegetables and fibrous 
carbs. You would get tired of chewing before you ate too much. 
For example, two cups of rice (a starchy carb) contains more than 400 calories, while two cups of 
broccoli (a fibrous carb) contains only 60 calories. The volume (the space it takes up on your plate—
and in your stomach) is the same, but there is almost a sevenfold difference in calorie density! 
COMMON TYPES OF COMPLEX CARBS (STARCHES AND FIBERS) 
Starches such as oats, beans, rice, potatoes, and whole grains do contain fiber. However, in this 
program and throughout the world of bodybuilding nutrition, we use the phrase ―fibrous carbs‖ to 
describe a separate category of leafy greens and other nonstarchy vegetables such as broccoli, 
asparagus, cauliflower, and salad greens. 
Combined with lean protein, fibrous carbs are your secret weapon in the war against fat. That‘s why 
a fat burning nutrition program should always be high in fibrous carbs and why it‘s important to know 
the difference between these two categories: 
Starchy Carbs (Grains and Starchy Vegetables) 
Fibrous Carbs (Nonstarchy Vegetables) 
Potatoes 
Broccoli 
Sweet potatoes 
Spinach 
Yams 
Asparagus

lists as well. 

================================================================================
QUICK START 
If you cut out refined carbs including sugar-sweetened beverages, white sugar, and white flour 
products, you’re 90 percent of the way there. To accelerate your fat burning to the next level, 
learn the difference between the fibrous carbs and the starchy carbs. Fill up your plate with 
more fibrous carbs (right next to your lean protein) and less starchy carbs and watch in 
amazement as the fat drops off your body. 
HIGH-GLYCEMIC VERSUS LOW-GLYCEMIC CARBS 
It is easy to classify carbs under two major categories, ―complex‖ and ―simple,‖ but it‘s an admittedly 
imperfect concept. The basic principle is that complex carbs are digested and released into the blood 
slowly, while simple carbs are digested and released into the blood quickly. Therefore, to maintain 
blood sugar levels, stay healthy, and burn fat, you should go for more of the slow-release complex 
carbs. That‘s not bad general health advice. But the way carbs are processed in the body isn‘t (pardon 
the pun) that simple. 
Each carbohydrate food may be released at different rates, regardless of its complexity. The 
glycemic index (GI) is a scale from 1 to 100 that was developed to measure how a carbohydrate food 
affects blood sugar. Surprisingly, some complex carbs, such as potatoes, break down into blood 
glucose very quickly. These are high-GI foods. Some simple carbs, such as apples, are converted into 
blood glucose more slowly. These are medium- or low-GI foods. 
The GI was initially created to help diabetics manage their blood sugar and it also has some 
applications in sports nutrition. Many weight-loss diets base their carb recommendations entirely on 
the GI, claiming that high-GI foods are fattening and low-GI foods are not. However, at least a half a 
dozen studies found that when all else is equal, eating low-GI foods does not increase fat loss. 
Like the concept of complex and simple, the GI has drawbacks that limit its usefulness. The GI scale 
was developed based on the effects of eating a fixed amount of carbs (50 grams) alone in a fasted 
state. When you eat carbs throughout the day in mixed meals that contain protein, fat, and fiber, that 
slows the release of sugar into the bloodstream. For example, if you combine potatoes with salmon 
and broccoli, the GI of the entire meal is much lower than potatoes alone. Many dieters ditch the 
potatoes, carrots, and other high-GI foods, thinking that ―slower-burning‖ carbs will lead to better fat 
loss. This is unnecessary, because fat loss is not about glycemic index, it‘s about energy balance. 
White potatoes, a high-GI food, may even satisfy your hunger better. In a study published in the 
European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers found that potatoes had the highest satiety index 
score of all the foods tested by far, revealing that potatoes make you feel fuller than other foods. To 
say that foods like potatoes are fattening and avoid them simply because they‘re high on the GI is a 
mistake. Both research and real world results confirm it. I‘ve eaten white potatoes every day during 
competition prep and had no trouble reaching single-digit body fat. 
If managing blood sugar is a concern, then GI is a factor you might consider. You may want to take 
it a step further and look into glycemic load (GL). GL overcomes one limitation of the GI by factoring 
in the amount of carbohydrate as well as the GI. Consult a doctor or a registered dietician for any 
clinical nutrition questions you have. For healthy people wanting to get leaner, there are far more 
important factors, including whether your carbs are natural or refined, high or low in calorie density, 
and high or low in nutrient density. 

================================================================================
NATURAL VERSUS REFINED CARBS 
For good health, the most important distinction you can make about carbs is the difference between 
natural and refined. The ultimate test for whether a carbohydrate is natural is to ask, ―Did this food 
come out of the ground or off the tree or plant this way?‖ If the answer is yes, then it‘s a natural, 
unrefined food. Vegetables and fruits are on the top of that list. 
Whole grains and unprocessed starches have an important place in muscle-building nutrition. 
Within your calorie and macronutrient limits, these natural carbs give you energy and help you get the 
most out of your training. But the more human hands meddle with them and process them to make 
them sweeter, more palatable, and longer lasting on the shelf, the more they lose their positive 
qualities and gain negatives. Refined grains and starches are not recommended, at least not as daily 
staples (that includes white pastas, white breads, pretzels, chips, crackers, and bagels). 
Of all the nutritional bad guys, refined-sugar products (white sugar, candy, pastries, soft drinks, and 
so on) are arguably the worst. An overdose of refined sugar and processed carbs is probably more 
responsible for poor health and excess body fat than any single factor. If you did only one thing 
starting today—reduce your refined sugar intake—the improvement in your health, energy, and body 
fat levels would astonish you! 
You might wonder, ―Can refined sugar really be that bad?‖ If your calories are under maintenance, 
what harm could a little cookie or candy bar do? If you kept your intake to ―a little‖ consumed 
occasionally, you‘d be right: It probably wouldn‘t impact your health or your physique at all. In fact, I 
encourage you not to eliminate your favorite foods completely unless you have a good reason. But ―a 
little‖ consumed every day habitually adds up over time. According to the USDA, the average 
American consumes 156 pounds of refined sugar every year. It‘s best to avoid processed carbs as 
much as possible. 
TEN REASONS TO AVOID PROCESSED CARBS 
  1.  Processed carbs can increase body fat. 
  2.  Processed carbs can increase triglycerides. 
  3.  Processed carbs can decrease good HDL cholesterol. 
  4.  Processed carbs can suppress your immune system. 
  5.  Processed carbs can deplete your body of important minerals. 
  6.  Processed carbs can increase insulin. 
  7.  Processed carbs can cause reactive hypoglycemia. 
  8.  Processed carbs can cause tooth decay. 
  9.  Processed carbs can promote diabetes. 
10.  Processed carbs are linked to depression. 
HOW TO GET THE PROCESSED CARBS OUT! 

================================================================================
Processed sugars are easily missed, because small amounts are hidden in foods you might never think 
of, such as nonfat salad dressings, steak sauce, tomato sauce, cranberry sauce, sliced lunch meats, 
ketchup, mayonnaise, soup, canned fruits, whole wheat bread, whole grain cereals, and too many 
others to mention. If you eat a lot of these items every day, it can add up. 
It would be difficult for most people to eliminate 100 percent of the sugar. Fortunately, you don‘t 
have to. If you get your calorie, protein, and micronutrient priorities in order, you don‘t need to give 
up your favorite sweet stuff completely. Simply cut back as much as you can, save for the occasional 
cheat meal, and do it gradually if necessary. Cold turkey doesn‘t work well for everyone. Start with 
the obvious calorie-dense culprits such as candy, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, desserts, sugary cereals, 
table sugar, and soft drinks. 
How strict to be with your sugar cutbacks is up to you. The American Heart Association suggests 
that men set a ―prudent‖ daily upper limit of 150 calories of added sugars and women an upper limit 
of 100 calories. The most successful people on this program usually keep their sweet treats and other 
―cheat meals‖ down to about twice a week. They don‘t let eating refined carbs and sugar become a 
daily habit. 
HOW TO SPOT REFINED SUGARS BY READING FOOD LABELS 
Don‘t judge a food entirely by the grams of carbs or even the grams of sugar on the nutrition facts 
panel because that doesn‘t tell you what kind of sugar it is. Dig a little deeper and inspect the 
ingredients list to see if refined sugars have been added, then make your decisions based on the 
calories, total carbs, and type of carbs. 
For example, on the nutrition facts panel of one popular brand of sugar-free, fat-free yogurt, it says 
that out of 15 grams of carbohydrates, 9 grams are sugar. But if you look at the ingredients, you‘ll see 
that there are no added sugars. The 9 grams of sugar come from lactose, the naturally occurring 
simple sugar in dairy products. 
Added refined sugars can be found in the list of ingredients under different names, including high-
fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, rice syrup, glucose syrup, sucrose, dextrose, brown sugar, turbinado 
sugar, and invert sugar. By law, the ingredients have to be listed in the order of their precedence, so if 
refined sugar is listed as one of the top two or three ingredients, that‘s not a food you want to eat in 
large amounts or on a daily basis. 
THE CALORIE DENSITY PRINCIPLE 
For fat loss, one of the most important distinctions you can make about carbs is calorie density—the 
number of calories per unit of volume. Dietary fats have the highest-calorie density of all the 
macronutrients, at 9 calories per gram, but a lot of refined carbs and sugars are surprisingly calorie 
dense. They‘re also highly palatable and easy to overeat. With 270 calories per cup, pasta is a prime 
example. Most people are more likely to have 3 cups of pasta than 1. That‘s 810 calories, not 
including what you put on it or what you drink with it. 
Pasta, bread, bagels, and cereal are complex carbs, but all of them are processed. (You‘ve never 
seen a bagel tree, have you?) Milling, refining, and bleaching the grains decreases the nutritional value 
while increasing the calorie density. Whole grain varieties are better, because they retain some of the 
nutrients and fiber, but even these are somewhat processed and may be high in calories. 

================================================================================
You should also be cautious of ―natural‖ sugars. Many people swear off white sugar and look for 
natural alternatives. While sweeteners like honey, agave nectar, maple syrup, and molasses are less 
refined and may have nutritional value, they‘re still calorie dense and they‘re still sugar. 
In ―natural‖ cereals or baked goods, you often see sweeteners like evaporated cane juice, which is 
called ―a healthy alternative to refined sugar.‖ It‘s easy to feel righteous shopping in a health food 
store and choosing the ―natural‖ product instead of the one with white sugar. Just remember, 
―natural,‖ ―healthier,‖ or ―more nutritious‖ do not always mean ―low-calorie.‖ It‘s possible to get fat 
on high-calorie natural carbs. If you want to keep high-calorie sugars to a minimum and you want to 
avoid artificial sweeteners, consider the herb stevia as a natural low-calorie sweetener. 
THE NUTRIENT DENSITY PRINCIPLE 
If you want to get leaner and healthier, focus on calorie quantity and quality, not one or the other. You 
can still lose weight while eating sugar if you‘re in a calorie deficit, but this doesn‘t mean a low-
calorie Twinkie diet is good for you, especially over the long haul. It‘s important to hit your calorie 
target, but the ideal plan is to choose foods that give you the maximum nutritional value from every 
calorie you eat. The fewer calories you eat, the more important this is. 
A food that has a large amount of vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and other nutrients per unit 
of volume is known as having high ―nutrient density.‖ Fibrous vegetables and whole fruits top the 
carb list. When you‘re on a calorie budget, these nutrient-dense carbs are the best place to spend your 
calories first. The natural starches and grains are also high in micronutrition; these carbs simply come 
with more calories, so watch the quantities. 
Always be aware of the nutritional value of everything you eat, given how many calories it‘s 
costing you. Think of every food—and especially sugar—the way you think of money when you‘re on 
a tight budget. Ask yourself, ―Is it worth spending my calories on this?‖ White sugar, for example, has 
no vitamins, no minerals, no amino acids, just pure empty calories. 
HOW MANY CARBS? WHAT THE LEANEST PEOPLE IN THE 
WORLD DO 
Most of the traditional health and nutrition organizations recommend getting about 55 percent of your 
calories from carbs. That‘s not a bad carb guideline for active, metabolically healthy people, provided 
the quantity is right and quality is high. The baseline for carbs on Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is 50 
percent of total daily calories. That‘s just slightly lower than the conventional recommendations, 
which allows for a slightly higher protein intake. This is a sensible starting point because it‘s balanced, 
maintainable, and nonrestrictive, and it supports hard training. 
In the example below, you‘ll see what a typical baseline would look like on a fat-loss program (for 
maintenance or muscle-gain programs, all these numbers would be higher). 
Baseline Carb Recommendations for Women 
1,600 CALORIES PER DAY 
1,600 calories × 50 percent = 800 calories from carbs 
There are 4 calories in each gram of carbs. 
800 carb calories ÷ 4 = 200 grams of carbs per day 

================================================================================
Baseline Carb Recommendations for Men 
2,300 CALORIES PER DAY 
2,300 calories × 50 percent = 1,150 calories from carbs 
There are 4 calories in each gram of carbs. 
1,150 carb calories ÷ 4 = 287 grams of carbs per day 
For carbohydrates, more than any other macronutrient, it‘s absolutely vital to customize, because 
one rigid prescription doesn‘t account for individual goals, sugar tolerance, activity levels, or type of 
training. After you establish your baseline and see how you respond, you can make carb adjustments 
based on your results. 
This is where the physique athlete method is superior to rigid low-carb diets or high-carb diets. 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is not high-carb or low-carb, it‘s carb-customized. You have lots of 
room to adjust your carb intake on this program. In fact, the lean protein and healthy fats often remain 
fairly steady and it‘s the carbs that get tweaked up or down the most. 
When you want to accelerate fat loss or break a fat-loss plateau, you might drop the total amount or 
ratio of carbs. Occasionally, you may even use the counterintuitive strategy of spiking your carb 
calories. These techniques are so effective for stubborn fat and end-stage fat loss (those last 10 
pounds) that bodybuilders have developed an entire system of reduced carb dieting with carb cycling. 
You‘ll learn about that in the last section of the book, which focuses on accelerating your results. 
For now, focus on getting your baseline nutrition in order; clear out all those processed carbs and 
replace them with natural, nutrient dense carbs. When the time comes, those advanced carb-
manipulation techniques will be there, and they can unlock a whole other level of lean for you. 
BURN THE FAT, FEED THE MUSCLE ACTION SUMMARY: 
CARBOHYDRATES 
• Eat natural, unprocessed carbs; reduce processed, refined carbs as much as possible, especially the 
―whites‖: white sugar, white flour. 
• Learn the difference between starchy carbs and fibrous carbs. (Memorize the lists!) 
• Eat a starchy carb and a fibrous carb with each meal (along with your protein). 
• Eat fruit every day with meals or as snacks. If you don‘t have a fibrous vegetable with a meal, 
have a fruit. 
• Aim for 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day or 14 grams per 1,000 calories of energy expenditure. If 
you follow the Burn the Fat meal templates (Chapter 14), you‘ll easily hit your fiber goal 
automatically. 
• As a baseline, aim for approximately 50 percent of your total calories from natural carbs. (Follow 
the meal templates and you‘ll come close to this amount automatically.) 
• Customize your carb intake based on your activity, body type, and results.

CHAPTER 12 
Hydrate Like an Athlete 
and Burn More Fat 
If you dehydrate your body, it’s like dehydrating your plants. Who wants to have a wilted body? 
—Dr. Lawrence E. Lamb, author of The Weighting Game: The Truth About Weight Control 
THE MOST ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT OF ALL: DO YOU TAKE IT 
FOR GRANTED? 
Fitness enthusiasts looking for an edge tend to focus on what‘s new and sexy in nutrition science, so 
it‘s no surprise that something as simple and ubiquitous as water is easily overlooked. But ignoring 
proper hydration is a costly mistake. If you want a leaner and more muscular body, you need to eat 
like an athlete and train like an athlete. If you train like an athlete, you need to hydrate like an athlete. 
Dr. Bob Murray, founder of Sports Science Insights, says, ―From an athlete‘s standpoint, or 
anybody who is physically active, hydration is the number one nutritional intervention for protecting 
performance, making us feel good during exercise and recovering afterwards. There is no cheaper, 
easier, and more effective way at getting the most out of our bodies and improving performance.‖ 
Water is the most abundant compound in your body, making up 60 percent to 70 percent of your 
weight. Your blood is about 90 percent water. Your muscles are 70 percent water. Even your bones 
are 20 percent water. Water is necessary to regulate your body temperature, transport nutrients, build 
tissues, and remove wastes from cells. Water is required for joint lubrication, brain function, digestion, 
circulation, respiration, absorption, and excretion. Without water, nothing in your body works 
properly. 
HOW DEHYDRATION AFFECTS YOUR ENERGY, STRENGTH, AND 
PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE 
Did you ever wake up in the morning feeling so groggy it almost felt like a hangover? Guess what? 
You may have been dehydrated. In fact, a hangover—headache, dry mouth, tiredness, and fatigue—is 
partially caused by the diuretic effects of alcohol. Do you usually enjoy excellent workouts, but some 
days your butt is dragging by the end—or, worse, you can‘t get started? Guess what? You were 
probably dehydrated. 
The effects of dehydration creep up on you. By the time you feel the full impact, it‘s too late: 
You‘re already dehydrated. If it‘s not particularly hot, you might not link the symptoms to lack of 
water. You might think you‘re just overworked, you didn‘t get enough sleep, or you‘re coming down 
with something. 
As you become dehydrated, your body‘s core temperature increases. This adversely affects your 
cardiovascular function and reduces your physical work capacity. As it gets more severe, your risk of 
heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke increases. 

================================================================================
Even mild dehydration equal to 1 percent of your body weight can impair exercise 
thermoregulation. For a 200-pound person, that‘s only 2 pounds, but can occur in as little as 30 to 60 
minutes of sweaty training. A study from the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found 
that a 1.5 percent loss of water weight reduced bench press strength by 5.6 percent. With a 3 percent 
loss, muscle strength can decrease by 10 percent. When you lose 4 percent to 5 percent or more of 
your body weight in water, muscular and aerobic endurance can decrease by 20 percent to 30 percent. 
If you lose more than 10 percent of your body‘s weight as water, you could die. 
HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU DRINK? 
Making general recommendations for water intake is challenging because individual needs vary 
dramatically, especially with exercise and heat stress. You can lose water in sweat at rates over 3 liters 
per hour, and total daily fluid requirements are known to range from as low as 2 liters to 10 liters per 
day or more. 
Among the general public, the most common guideline is ―drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per 
day‖ (8 × 8 or 64 ounces; approximately 2 liters per day). In the bodybuilding world, ―drink a gallon a 
day‖ (3.8 liters or 128 ounces) is not uncommon advice. 
In recent years, there has been a reevaluation and major debate over water guidelines. Several 
nephrologists reviewed all the research, said they couldn‘t figure out where the 8 × 8 rule came from 
and claimed there was no evidence to back it up. Before you knew it, fitness writers and bloggers were 
telling people the opposite: ―8 × 8 is a myth! Stop drinking so much water!‖ (I know, so confusing, 
right?) 
No doubt, the profitable bottled water industry has a vested interest in the ―Drink more water‖ 
message, but that doesn‘t mean it‘s a myth or a conspiracy. If I were you, I wouldn‘t be so quick to 
drop your water intake without evaluating your individual needs and considering adequate versus 
optimal. 
The origin of 8 × 8 seems clear: It corresponds with the original recommendations made by the 
National Research Council to consume at least 1 milliliter for every calorie burned. That puts 8 × 8 at 
the minimum recommended level. 
These doctors and journalists who appeared intent on debunking the ―Drink more water‖ message 
were mainly reminding us that water guidelines include total water (which includes water from other 
beverages and moisture in food), not just drinking water. They were also only questioning 8 × 8 as a 
rigid rule. The truth is 64 ounces of total water each day might be inadequate for many people, 
especially those who work out. 
HOW TO FIND YOUR PERSONAL CUSTOMIZED WATER INTAKE 
A basic principle of Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is to customize everything and avoid one-size-fits-
all mind-sets, programs, and recommendations. This goes for water intake just as it does for calories, 
protein, carbs, and other nutrients. 
Large people need more water than smaller people, and active individuals need more than inactive 
folks. Climate is a huge factor. If you work or train in the heat, your water needs are much higher. If 
you follow a high-protein diet, it‘s also smart to slide to the higher side of the recommended water 
range. 
In 2004 the Institute of Medicine in Washington, D.C., convened to set new dietary reference 
intakes (DRIs) for water. The recommendations were based on experimental and observational human 

================================================================================
research. Although they made it clear that water needs can vary dramatically and this number was 
only a median, they concluded that a daily total water intake of 3.7 liters for adult men and 2.7 liters 
for adult women covers the majority of individuals. 
INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE GUIDELINES FOR WATER (DRI) 
Men 
Women 
3.7 liters (125 oz.) per day 
2.7 liters (91 oz.) per day 
If you want a customized guideline, you can use the National Research Council‘s recommendation: 
1.0 to 1.5 milliliters per kilocalorie expended per day. (You calculated your total daily calorie 
expenditure in Chapter 7: Women burn an average of about 2,100 calories per day and men burn 
approximately 2,700 calories per day.) Use the high end of the required water range if you‘re active or 
you train in the heat.

QUICK START 
Men: drink approximately 3.5 liters of water a day. Women: drink approximately 2.5 liters of 
water a day. Follow this one tip and your hydration needs will be covered under all normal 
conditions, with room to spare. Drink more water if you get extremely active, and even more if 
you’re training in the heat. 

================================================================================
SHOULD YOU COUNT THE LIQUIDS FROM FOODS AND 
BEVERAGES TOWARD YOUR WATER INTAKE? 
These recommendations are based on total water, so all fluids do count. Almost all foods contain 
water. Fruits and vegetables are 75 percent to 90 percent water. Even meat is at least 50 percent water. 
Milk, coffee, tea, and sports drinks are mostly water. Caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, but not 
enough to cancel the hydration provided from caffeinated liquids. (Don‘t use caffeinated drinks for 
rehydration, however.) 
It‘s difficult to determine the exact amount of water you‘re getting from food, so don‘t bother. In 
general, the average person gets about 20 percent of their water intake from food, provided they eat 
fruits and vegetables every day. 
It‘s not uncommon for bodybuilders to use the total water guidelines as their daily target for 
drinking water. I do. My calorie expenditure is about 3,200 per day, so that‘s at least 3.2 liters or 
usually closer to a gallon (3.8 liters)—well over 8 × 8. I drink that amount in pure water every day. 
My method puts you on the high side when you add water from all sources, but it doesn‘t hurt. It 
offers an extra margin of assurance that your water intake is more than adequate and perhaps is closer 
to optimum. Personally, I feel better, train harder, and have more energy when my water intake is on 
the high side rather than the low side. I‘ve heard this sentiment echoed throughout the fitness industry 
for decades. 
CAN DRINKING MORE WATER INCREASE FAT LOSS? 
Many health experts outside the athletic community focus on deficiency prevention. They‘re mostly 
concerned with finding the minimum amounts needed for maintaining health or avoiding illness in 
average or sedentary people. Instead of finding out how little you can drink before your results suffer, 
why not search for what‘s optimal and see if your results improve? 
It‘s clear that dehydration decreases your performance and becomes dangerous as it progresses. It‘s 
also clear that with all nutrients, there‘s a difference between deficiency and adequacy. Could there be 
an optimal level for water, beyond adequate, that improves your fat loss? We don‘t know for sure 
because there‘s a lack of strong evidence to confirm it. However, drinking water can help your fat-loss 
efforts in many ways, and some of them make a huge difference. 
The most controversial theory is water-induced thermogenesis. Experiments at the German Institute 
of Human Nutrition found that drinking cold water increased metabolic rate in adults by 24 percent to 
30 percent for 30 to 60 minutes. An Israeli study published in the International Journal of Obesity 
reported similar results in children: a 25 percent increase in resting energy expenditure lasting for over 
40 minutes. Some people speculate that when the water is cold (3 to 4 degrees Celsius), your body 
must heat it up, and that burns calories. Other scientists say the mechanism has to do with sympathetic 
nervous system stimulation or improved cellular metabolism. 
The big question is whether this small, short-term metabolism boost continues and adds up to body 
fat loss over time. If it does help, it‘s a small effect. The Israeli scientists said that simply following 
the standard water drinking guidelines theoretically adds an additional weight loss of about 1.2 
kilograms (2.6 pounds) per year. The most optimistic projection is about 5 pounds in a year. Not much 
either way, but considering how easy it is to do, my guess is that you‘ll take every extra bit of fat loss 
you can get. 
Drinking water before or during a meal also helps. Water may not be a true appetite suppressant (in 
the hormonal sense), but water can increase stomach fullness and reduce calorie intake at a meal. In a 
2008 study from Virginia Tech, subjects drank 500 milliliters of water about 30 minutes before 

================================================================================
breakfast. Calorie intake decreased by 13 percent. In a 2010 follow-up study, 500 milliliters of water 
was consumed before every main meal, and weight loss was 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) greater over a 
12-week period. 
There‘s not much research on long-term effects, but a 12-month study was conducted at the 
Oakland Hospital Research Institute. Increases in drinking water were associated with significant fat 
loss and loss of body weight in overweight subjects. An obvious reason was because they swapped 
caloric drinks for water. Even after accounting for this, the water drinkers still showed increases in 
weight loss—about 5 pounds in a year. 
A lot less controversial (this one‘s a sure thing) is the replacement strategy. Cutting something out 
cold turkey creates a void that begs to be filled, so it helps if you think in terms of replacement rather 
than removal. Every time you get the urge to reach for a soda or another caloric drink, tell yourself, 
―I‘ll have water instead.‖ Within a few weeks, you‘ll have a positive new habit installed. The average 
person saves at least 200 calories per day with this one simple swap. On paper, that‘s 20.8 pounds of 
fat gone in one year. If you‘ve been drinking sugar-sweetened beverages every day, this could be the 
best bang-for-your-buck fat-loss tactic in the entire book. 
As you can see, there‘s plenty of evidence showing a variety of ways that water is your friend for 
fat loss as well as for health, energy, and performance. Drinking water may also be tied strongly to 
other healthy behaviors. Healthy habits come in clusters: drink more water, and you automatically 
start doing other healthy stuff. 
Many people thumb their noses at increasing their water intake, complaining that it‘s too much 
trouble or drinking when you‘re thirsty is good enough. But if you‘re serious about sports or fitness, is 
it really? 
THIRST: IS IT A GOOD SIGNAL FOR HYDRATION? 
Your body has an exquisite homeostatic thirst mechanism that guides you to rehydrate and restore 
water balance on a day-to-day basis. The problem is that thirst isn‘t a good indicator for maintaining 
hydration, especially for athletes. By the time your body registers the sensation of thirst, you may 
already be underhydrated. This becomes truer as you get older, when the thirst mechanism doesn‘t 
work as well as it used to. 
Most people don‘t drink purely based on thirst; they drink in response to other stimuli, such as 
mealtimes, walking past a fountain, or when drinks are offered during social events. Instead of waiting 
until you‘re parched or otherwise prompted, the proactive strategy for optimal hydration is to drink 
water throughout the day, before training and during training, even when you‘re not thirsty. 
In addition to thirst, urine color and body weight are two other practical ways to monitor your 
hydration level. Your urine should be clear to straw-colored and odorless. If it‘s a deep or dark color 
with a strong odor, you‘re dehydrated. (Note: Some vitamin supplements and medications can darken 
urine color.) If you sweat heavily during exercise, check your weight before and after each workout. 
Replace any weight lost during an exercise bout with water. 
CAN YOU DRINK TOO MUCH WATER? 
Science and health organizations have not set a tolerable upper intake level (UL), probably because 
water intoxication is so rare. You see it mostly in athletes (especially females), who replace heavy 
sweat losses after long endurance events with copious amounts of plain water without the needed 
electrolytes. This leads to hyponatremia, a low concentration of sodium in the blood, which can lead 

================================================================================
to swelling of the brain; this can be fatal. Hyponatremia is rare outside the endurance sports world, but 
one case was publicized after a water drinking contest sponsored by a radio station in California 
(―Hold your wee to win a Wii‖). 
Bodybuilders and competitive athletes have been known to take their training and nutrition not only 
seriously, but to extremes. They‘re often perfectionists, not satisfied until they reach 100 percent on 
their nutritional scorecard. This is admirable, but sometimes can lead to a more-is-better mentality, 
and more of a good thing is not always better. ―Drink as much as you can tolerate‖ is not good advice, 
even though sports nutrition organizations have given it in the past. 
Don‘t forget practical considerations as well. If you buy bottled water, there‘s extra expense, plus 
an impact on the environment (from production, transportation, and disposal). And if you drink so 
much that you must be a few steps from a bathroom 24-7, you‘re probably overdoing it. 
A SIMPLE HYDRATION SCHEDULE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT 
THE OPTIMAL ―BURN‖ 
You can drink water whenever you want, but there are a several times when drinking can be especially 
helpful. Following a schedule also helps turn the behavior into a habit, making it something you don‘t 
have to think about. 
First, drink immediately when you wake up in the morning because you haven‘t had fluids all night. 
Suggestion: Keep a glass of water by your bedside so it‘s waiting for you when you wake up. 
Prebreakfast water intake may help with your daily calorie control efforts and it also sets a good, 
healthy tone for the day. 
Second, drink before your workouts. Shoot for about 500 milliliters (16 ounces) anywhere from 2 
hours to 20 minutes prior to training (with or apart from a meal). 
Third, drink during your workouts. Most sports nutritionists recommend about 200 to 250 milliliters 
every 15 minutes. Water is the best drink for strength and general fitness workouts of an hour or less. 
Sophisticated strength and physique athletes sometimes experiment with amino acids during the 
workout, but this isn‘t mandatory and benefits are not conclusive, given adequate protein intake from 
food. If you‘re an athlete with endurance training bouts longer than one hour, be certain to consult 
your coach or a sports nutritionist for advice on water, carbohydrate, and electrolyte replacement. 
Fourth, drink after your workout. The goal is to begin rehydrating immediately after the workout to 
replace any water-weight loss before the next session. Half a liter (500 milliliters) of water represents 
about one pound of body weight lost. 
Fifth, drink when it‘s hot and you‘re sweating, even if it‘s not during a formal workout. 
On your nontraining days, you don‘t need as much water, but remember to drink up in the morning 
and keep drinking throughout the day, as you won‘t be prompted by your training session. Mealtime is 
a great cue: Two of the easiest fat-loss strategies are drinking water before meals and drinking water 
during meals (in place of caloric drinks). 
THE DARK SIDE OF LIQUID CALORIES 
Barry Popkin, professor of global nutrition at the University of North Carolina, said, ―Perhaps nothing 
has contributed more to our weight gain than the clash between our drinking habits and our biology.‖ 
There‘s no doubt about it: Caloric drinks are keeping a lot of people fat. 
In the United States, the primary source is sugar-sweetened beverages, with cola and other soft 
drinks leading the way. Now a close second are specialty and dessert coffees. A Starbucks 

================================================================================
Frappuccino can cost you 500 calories or more. A Dunkin Donuts Frozen Mocha Coffee Coolatta has 
360 calories—and that‘s the small size with skim milk! The large one with cream will set you back 
1050 calories! That‘s two-thirds of a typical female‘s daily calorie intake on a fat-loss program. 
Energy drinks high in sugar and caffeine round out the top three, and I‘m sure you know someone 
who practically lives on those things. Whereas a 12-ounce can of soda usually runs you 140 to 160 
calories, many of the popular energy drinks come in 16-, 20-, or 23-ounce sizes and clock in at 220 to 
345 calories. 
Many people think that fruit juice is an improvement over soda, but whole fruit is better. Whole 
fruit gives you fiber, contains fewer calories, and satisfies your appetite more. Unless you‘re an athlete 
with very long workouts or events, skip the sports drinks, too: They‘re sugar water with electrolytes, 
not fat-loss food. Whether or not it‘s ―natural,‖ liquid sugar makes calorie control much more difficult. 
Sugar-sweetened beverages have a high calorie density, and they require no chewing, so they can be 
consumed more quickly than solid food. They also have a low satiety value. Scientists recently 
confirmed that, compared to whole foods, liquid calories produce a smaller increase in satiety 
hormone GLP-1 and a smaller decrease in the hunger hormone ghrelin. 
At no time in our history have we had access to such large amounts of liquid calories. Alcohol may 
have been around as far back as 5000 BC, but even that is a blip on the evolutionary calendar of 
humanity. What did our ancestors drink? As infants, breast milk. As adults, water. As a result, our 
genetic code never developed the physiological mechanisms to properly register the calories in liquids 
the way it does when we eat whole foods. 
If you counted calories carefully and made sure you hit your calorie target for the day, there would 
be little or no difference in weight loss regardless of whether you ate your calories or drank them. The 
trouble is most people are terrible at tracking their calorie intake. Hunger gets the best of them and 
they drink calories in addition to their usual food intake, not instead of it. 
Bottom line: The best strategy to beat body fat is to cut out all sugar-sweetened beverages. 
WHAT ABOUT DIET SODA AND OTHER NONCALORIC DRINKS? 
Diet soda, diet tea, Crystal Light, flavored waters, and other diet drinks are artificially sweetened, so 
they contain few or no calories. Artificial sweeteners, however, have been burned at the stake in the 
court of public opinion, especially aspartame (brand name Equal). Sucralose (brand name Splenda) 
doesn‘t generate as many complaints, but artificial sweeteners have become controversial and 
unpopular in general. 
Let me first point out the obvious: Diet soft drinks contain absolutely nothing healthy. But does that 
mean they‘re toxic? A basic premise of toxicology is that the dose makes the poison. There‘s little 
reason to believe that light or infrequent use of diet drinks is harmful. If you drink them by the six-
pack every day, who knows? I don‘t recommend that. 
Second question: Can diet drinks cause weight gain? As paradoxical as it sounds, some people 
believe they do. However, the idea that ―diet soda makes you fat‖ confuses correlation with causation. 
If you survey overweight people about their beverages, you might discover that as a group they drink a 
lot of diet soda. Is it more likely that the calorie-free soda caused them to gain weight or that they 
started drinking the diet soda because they were trying to lose weight they‘d already gained? Rest 
assured that diet drinks by themselves do not cause weight gain. If a drink doesn‘t have calories and it 
doesn‘t stimulate appetite or trigger excess food intake, it can‘t make you fat. 
It is possible, however, that diet drinks sharpen your sweet tooth. They also might create a false 
sense of security and entitlement to eat something else because of the calories you saved from the 

================================================================================
drink. Remember that using drinks with no calories is not a free pass to eat extra calories elsewhere or 
pay no attention to your deficit. 
All things considered, I recommend drinking mostly water and keeping artificial anything to a 
minimum. If you want an occasional diet drink, go ahead and have it, just like you might have an 
occasional glass of wine or a cheat meal. You‘ll never find diet soda stockpiled in my refrigerator, but 
a diet cherry cola once in a while sure takes the edge off a strict diet, and I‘ve never seen a shred of 
hard evidence that diet drinks slow down fat loss if all else remains equal. 
COFFEE AND TEA 
If you read the health headlines, it seems like one year experts say coffee is bad for you, the next it‘s 
good, and the year after that it‘s bad again. Drives you crazy, doesn‘t it? Many nutritionists and 
trainers suggest avoiding caffeinated beverages, and there‘s a negative vibe about caffeine in the 
health and fitness world in general. Ironically, caffeine increases thermogenesis and lipolysis, plus 
many people find it helps as a preworkout stimulant. Coffee also provides antioxidants and some 
research shows it may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. 
However, caffeine is not entirely benign. It can elevate heart rate and blood pressure. Large doses 
may acutely affect your blood sugar and insulin, and it may disrupt your sleep if you have it late in the 
day. Some people are more sensitive than others, but condemning coffee without discussing dose and 
context is silly. The problem is not coffee, it‘s the abuse of caffeine or other stimulants. Truth be told, 
I love my Starbucks. The difference between me and folks who don‘t have abs is I drink coffee black, 
with only a splash of skim milk and maybe a no-calorie sweetener. They drink mochas and 
Frappuccinos. 
The calories you put in your coffee will add to a surplus or chip away at your deficit. Even a little 
cream and sugar in your coffee adds up if you drink a lot, and these are the kind of calories most 
people forget to count. If you don‘t chug your joe by the pot or with a lot of added calories, there‘s no 
reason to believe it will harm your health or halt your fat loss. It might even help. 
Unsweetened tea is another great beverage for fat-loss programs. But take heed: Sugar-sweetened 
tea drinks are not. One popular brand of bottled green tea made the Men’s Health list of the 20 worst 
drinks in America, with 240 calories and 61 grams of sugar in one 20-ounce serving. 
Arguments over which tea is healthiest abound, as many contain bioactive compounds such as 
polyphenols, carotenoids, and flavonoids. If there are no calories, I suggest you simply drink whatever 
type of tea you enjoy. My favorites are antioxidant-rich green tea and Captain Picard‘s choice: Earl 
Grey. Hot. 
WILL ALCOHOL MAKE YOU FAT? 
An occasional glass of wine or a couple of beers will probably do no harm to your health or waistline, 
provided you budget for the calories. Red wine has been associated with some health benefits, such as 
increasing good HDL cholesterol. Excessive alcohol, on the other hand, can easily derail your 
performance and slow your fat loss. 
Your body has no storage capacity for alcohol as it does for carbs and fats. Alcohol must be 
detoxified as quickly as possible (which is why some people consider it a poison). As a result, the 
oxidation of alcohol takes priority over other macronutrients. In other words, while your liver is busy 
metabolizing those beers you drank, the use of fat for fuel is almost entirely suppressed. 

================================================================================
THE HIGH CALORIE DENSITY/LOW NUTRIENT DENSITY 
PROBLEM 
Alcohol is not converted directly into body fat; it‘s metabolized by your liver. However, this doesn‘t 
mean it doesn‘t contribute to fat gain. With seven calories per gram, alcohol is calorie dense and the 
calories add up with the food you eat. It‘s a poor way to spend your calories, because those calories 
have almost no nutritional value. 
Red wine contains healthy compounds like polyphenols and some alcoholic beverages provide 
traces of vitamins or minerals. But considering that you get a wide variety of antioxidants and 
micronutrients from fruits and vegetables, it‘s foolish to recommend beer or wine as a source of 
nutrition. In fact, alcohol interferes with digestion and absorption of many vital nutrients, including B 
vitamins niacin, thiamin, and zinc. 
ALCOHOL AND YOUR HEALTH 
Excessive alcohol use is linked to numerous health problems, including heart disease, high blood 
pressure, stroke, cardiomyopathy, abnormal heart rhythms, liver disease, stomach problems, cancer, 
decreased resistance to infections, gout, and hypoglycemia. And don‘t forget alcoholism and all the 
troubles that come along with addiction. 
Although alcohol is liquid, it‘s a potent diuretic. It pulls water from the cells and increases water 
loss through the kidneys, leading to all the negative effects of dehydration. 
Heavy drinking suppresses testosterone, one of the main muscle-building hormones. And alcohol is 
like other liquid calories: You don‘t compensate properly for the extra calories. Good-bye, abs; hello, 
beer belly. Basically, booze can ruin your health, make you fat, and rob you of muscle if the drinking 
gets out of control. 
Five Tips for Drinking Sensibly Without Compromising Your Results 
There are plenty of food cops who will tell you to never let a drop of alcohol cross your lips, but if 
you‘re a wine or beer lover, I think it‘s better to enjoy your drink if you can do it moderately and 
sensibly. I also believe that for long-term success, it‘s important that you‘re happy and that your 
nutrition program is socially acceptable. Here‘s the best way to approach it: 
1. REDEFINE MODERATION. 
―Moderation‖ is a fuzzy word in nutrition circles, but in the case of alcohol it‘s usually defined as one 
drink for women and two for men. Doing this daily could add up to 14 drinks per week. That‘s not 
moderation in my book. I strongly urge you to avoid daily drinking (or daily junk food eating, for that 
matter), because behaviors repeated daily become habits. Habits are hard to break and habitual 
drinking can escalate. Save the drinking for weekends, or even less often—only for holidays and 
special occasions (you might enjoy it more that way). 
Binge drinking has no place in a fitness lifestyle, and hangovers aren‘t conducive to good workouts. 
If you drink frequently or in large amounts, don‘t complain about your fat-loss plateau. Look in the 
mirror and admit the truth: ―I‘m not that serious about getting in shape. It‘s not a high priority right 
now. I don‘t want it that bad.‖ At least you‘re being honest with yourself. 
2. ALWAYS COUNT THE CALORIES AND STAY WITHIN YOUR DEFICIT. 

================================================================================
In the final analysis, weight loss is calories in versus calories out. If you count your alcohol calories 
and stay within your limits, you‘ll still lose weight. The problem is most people forget to add up the 
calories in all their drinks, and alcohol can increase your appetite. Men in particular are not good at 
compensating: They tend to eat in addition to drinking, while women usually drink instead of eating. 
Alcohol can also lower your inhibitions. The more you drink, the easier it is to say, ―To heck with this 
diet!‖ The next thing you know, two drinks turn into six and you top it off with midnight pizza. 
I‘m often asked, ―What‘s the best alcoholic drink when you‘re dieting? Best answer: none. Second-
best answer: the drink with the least calories. Mixed drinks with high-calorie additives such as milk, 
juice, sugar, or tropical drink mixes can completely undermine your fat-loss goals. A light beer 
contains about 95 calories. An 8-ounce margarita packs about 500 calories. And if you like piña 
coladas, you‘d better like hours of cardio, because a big one can cost you up to 640 calories. Two of 
those isn‘t moderation, it‘s diet sabotage. 
3. GET TO BED EARLY AND DON’T COMPROMISE YOUR SLEEP. 
Drinking and late nights often go together. Partying until the wee hours of the morning can mean 
abnormal sleeping patterns, less sleep, and lower sleep quality. Your body needs rest and thrives on 
structure and schedule. Disrupted sleep patterns often mean missed meals, poor workouts, and poor 
recovery. 
Scientists have discovered that inadequate sleep can wreak havoc on the hormones that regulate 
appetite, metabolism, and the anabolic/catabolic balance in your body. Sleep deprivation can increase 
ghrelin, decrease leptin, increase cortisol, and decrease insulin sensitivity. 
If this isn‘t enough, how about losing your hard-earned muscle while dieting? A Dutch study found 
that sleep curtailment (5.5 hours versus 8.5 hours) decreased the amount of weight lost as fat by 55 
percent. This came with increased hunger, reduced fat oxidation, and greater adaptation to the calorie 
deficit. 
4. BE STRONG IN THE FACE OF PEER PRESSURE, AND CHOOSE FRIENDS WISELY. 
If peer pressure is a problem, get tough and reaffirm your commitment to your goal. Decide in 
advance that you won‘t give in. If social temptation is a major problem, reconsider who you‘ve chosen 
as friends. Most people don‘t care that you‘re working on self-improvement. In fact, some people 
resent it if you improve and they don‘t. It‘s easier for an average person to reach up and pull you down 
than to climb up and improve themselves. 
People who aren‘t on the same path won‘t always support you if you tell them you‘re ―on a diet‖ or 
―in training.‖ It might make you a bigger target. Say, ―No, thanks‖ and nothing else, or invent a good 
excuse, real or imaginary: ―I have a stomach disorder, liver problem, etc.,‖ works nicely. Instead of 
being in a tense peer-pressure situation, you could make a game out of it. ―I‘m the designated driver‖ 
is always a good way out that your friends may appreciate. 
5. WHEN FAT LOSS IS YOUR GOAL, CONSIDER NOT DRINKING ALCOHOL AT ALL. 
If your goal is fat loss, you must stay in a calorie deficit, so you have fewer calories to work with. 
(This is true for females especially.) This means that to include alcoholic drinks, which are calorie 
dense and nutrient sparse, you must displace other foods that are packed with nutrients and more 
filling. Even if you know you can fit in a drink or two and stay within your deficit, you may want to 
ask yourself if those calories are worth it. If you‘re stuck on a progress plateau, the answer is obvious. 
HYDRATE LIKE AN ATHLETE AND BURN MORE FAT! 

================================================================================
The next time you‘re in a bar (hopefully not very often), take a look around. You won‘t find many 
successful fitness or bodybuilding champions hanging out there at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. And the next time 
you go to the gym, check out the bodybuilders and fitness models. You‘ll notice that they all lug 
around a bottle of water or even a gallon jug—all the time. Then look at how lean and muscular they 
are. Coincidence? Or do they know something that you don‘t? Drink up! Your H20, that is! 
CHAPTER 13 
Nutrient Timing 
From a muscle-development standpoint, when you eat is arguably as important as what you eat. This 
concept, called nutrient timing, has been extensively investigated by researchers, and studies show 
that consuming nutrients around your training session has a greater effect on anabolism than 
consuming them at other times of the day. 
—Brad Schoenfeld, author of The MAX Muscle Plan 
WHY WHEN YOU EAT MATTERS 
So far, you‘ve learned that if you want to burn fat and achieve great health at the same time, the 
quantity and the quality of your food are both vitally important. But improving your body composition 
is not entirely about what you eat and how much you eat, it‘s also about when you eat. 
Food quantity, quality, and timing all work together with exercise to increase your ability to train 
hard, recover from your workouts, gain lean muscle, and burn more fat. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle 
is not about nutrition or exercise alone—it‘s about the synergy you get from putting both together—
and these principles apply to every man and woman who trains hard. 
To maximize that synergy, you must provide fuel and building materials to your body when it needs 
them most, otherwise your nutrition plan won‘t work as well and even a well-designed training 
program becomes less effective. By using the nutrient-timing strategies you‘ll learn in this chapter, 
you can transform your body in a way you could never achieve with dieting alone or eating 
haphazardly. 
NUTRIENT-TIMING TACTICS OF THE LEANEST PEOPLE IN THE 
WORLD 
Fitness models, bodybuilders, and other super-lean people do things differently than the average 
dieter. Their meal plans are highly structured, they eat on time, they don‘t skip meals, they eat special 
pre- and postworkout meals, and they almost always eat breakfast. They typically eat four to six 
smaller meals per day rather than three big ones. 
For the average person, breakfast, lunch, and dinner is the most common and traditional meal 
schedule. As long you hit your goals for calories and macronutrients, and you eat healthy foods that 

================================================================================
give you all the nutrients you need, this program will still work well for you if you prefer only three 
―squares‖ a day. However, on Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, five or six meals a day is the standard 
best practice for men. Because women have lower calorie needs, four or five meals are more typical. 
That‘s an average of five feedings per day and all our sample meal plans fit this schedule. 
Why do so many athletes eat like this and swear by it? Many reasons have been proposed over the 
years, including more energy, less hunger, better muscle growth, increased fat loss, and psychological 
advantages. Not all the benefits once cited for eating often (such as increasing metabolism) have been 
scientifically verified, and meal frequency is a subject of great debate. 
However, one thing we do know is that this is how the leanest, most muscular people in the world 
have been eating for years. The success record in the fitness world goes back more than three decades, 
and this is the most tested, proven, and widely used meal plan in physique sports today for 
accomplishing both goals, getting leaner and building muscle. Here are some of the most common 
reasons in favor of eating often and on a regular schedule: 
1. It gives you the amount of fuel you need for great workouts when you need it. 
Couch potatoes don‘t burn many calories, so they don‘t need to eat as much, nor do they have to 
worry about pre- and postworkout nutrition. On the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle program, you do 
two types of workouts, cardio training and weight training. When you train like an athlete, you burn 
more calories and you have to feed your body like an athlete. The more often and more intensely you 
train, the more calories you need and the more important nutrient timing becomes. With more frequent 
meals, it‘s also easy for an athlete to fuel and refuel optimally and do it without feeling stuffed and 
bloated. 
2. It provides a steady flow of fuel and helps maintain high energy levels. 
Almost everyone who switches to a Burn the Fat‒style meal plan says they have more energy. No 
more mid-morning crashes, no more late afternoon drowsy spells, no more brain fog, no more ups and 
downs; just steady, high energy all day long—and more energy for workouts. Many people who have 
problems regulating blood sugar find it especially valuable to spread out their food intake. Eating 
regular meals with natural, slow-releasing carbs, fiber, lean proteins, and healthy fats stabilizes your 
blood sugar and prevents the energy ups and downs. 
3. It helps reduce appetite, control cravings, and prevent binges. 
When you go a long time without food, hunger becomes a problem. Mid-afternoon crashes or 
nighttime cravings that send you running for a junk food fix are often the result of skipping breakfast, 
leaving long gaps between meals, or eating randomly without a schedule at all. If you eat more often, 
hunger is rarely a concern. You feel psychologically satisfied as well and the impact on your eating 
behavior can be profound. Even if you get hungry, you can say to yourself, ―I can wait, because the 
next meal is just an hour or two away,‖ and when you do eat, there‘s no need to binge. 
4. It makes it easy to hit your protein quota. 
You need more protein when you‘re weight training. Getting the optimal daily amount is easy when 
it‘s spread over at least four or five servings compared to cramming it into two or three. Eating protein 
at each of those meals adds to the appetite control benefits as well. 
5. It supports muscle growth. 

================================================================================
Most bodybuilders believe that they get better muscle growth with more frequent meals. Getting the 
proper amount of daily calories and protein is most important, but research also supports the idea that 
spreading your protein intake throughout the day helps improve your muscular development. 
6. It builds discipline. 
Putting emphasis on structure, numbers, and timing develops discipline and attention to detail. I 
believe these are major factors that separate people with average bodies from people with the best 
bodies in the world. Quite simply, people with highly structured plans (they know what, when, how 
much, and even where they‘re going to eat) follow their plans better, reduce their risk of impulsive 
eating, and get better results. This discipline is transferable. When you‘re disciplined about eating, you 
become disciplined about training and other areas of life as well. 
7. It promotes healthy attitudes and behaviors toward food and fat loss. 
I also believe that eating often on a regular schedule is far healthier psychologically than typical 
deprivation diets or going entire days at a time eating nothing. Athletes think of food as fuel and the 
building blocks of health and muscle, not something to fear. In a world where many dieters are 
starving themselves and afraid to eat, looking at each meal as an opportunity to nourish, build, and 
energize your body makes you realize that food is your solution, not your problem. 
SHOULD YOU EAT LIKE A BODYBUILDER? 
Everyone is different, so I‘m not suggesting you must do what I did strictly because it worked for me. 
What I am saying is that bodybuilders and physique athletes are the exemplars in this field: They‘re 
the leanest people in the world. If you isolate the common denominators of success from a large group 
of high performers like this one, you have a success blueprint that you can copy with great confidence. 
If more muscle and less fat are your goals, try this type of meal schedule. I think you‘ll be amazed 
with the results. You can always customize your plan later so it suits your preferences and, most 
importantly, so it fits into your schedule and is easy to follow every day. For long-term success, you 
have to pick a plan that you can stick with as a lifestyle. 
So, if eating four to six times a day is good, then seven or eight times must be better, right? Not 
necessarily. Bodybuilders are famous for constantly eating. Some have been known to set their alarms 
to eat in the middle of the night! That might work for the pros, but it‘s unnecessary and probably 
impractical for most people. 
If you eat too often, you‘ll simply pile food on top of undigested food. For people with low calorie 
needs, such as short or petite women, splitting the day‘s intake into too many meals could make each 
meal too small to be satisfying. If you‘re the nibbler type of personality, you can certainly eat more 
than six times per day, but do that only if it suits you. There‘s no evidence that you can force your 
body to gain more muscle or burn more fat by trying to ―drip feed‖ protein and other nutrients into 
your system. 
WHAT IS THE IDEAL MEAL SCHEDULE? 
Traditional mealtimes on Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle are early morning breakfast, mid-morning 
snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack, dinner, and evening snack, but you should customize eating times 
to fit your schedule. For example, if you work third shift, you can simply eat your first meal whenever 

================================================================================
you wake up (even if that‘s in the afternoon) and arrange your meals so you eat every three or four 
waking hours after that. 
If you have an unusual work schedule that doesn‘t allow breaks for long stretches of time—if your 
meals are unevenly spaced or your day has fewer meals—don‘t panic. The important thing is to set up 
a regular meal plan you can stick with, hit your calorie and protein targets by the end of your day 
(every 24 hours), and follow the other program guidelines to the best of your ability. 
Whatever meal schedule you choose, follow it consistently every day. Missing a meal occasionally 
won‘t make your metabolism crash or your muscles waste away, but missing planned meals or eating 
unplanned calories are major mistakes to avoid. 
A study from the University of Nottingham in the UK found that irregular meal patterns can lower 
the thermic effect of food, disrupt glucose metabolism, increase insulin resistance, and create other 
types of metabolic disarray. The study also said that irregular eaters have trouble properly adjusting 
their calorie intake as the day goes on, which can lead to weight gain over the long term. 
I‘ve discovered something similar: People who eat without structure find it almost impossible to 
troubleshoot fat-loss plateaus because they‘ve never established a baseline. Haphazard eating patterns 
lead to fat-loss failure. 
WHAT IS THE PERFECT MEAL SIZE? 
The size of your meals can vary a lot. It depends on your total calorie needs and how many meals you 
eat, but if you follow the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle guidelines, meal size is easy to figure out. 
The average fat-loss meal plan has about 2,100 to 2,500 calories per day for men and 1,400 to 1,800 
for women. If you‘re a serious athlete or fitness enthusiast with high activity levels, your calorie needs 
will be higher. To get your ideal intake per meal, simply choose how many meals you want and then 
divide your total daily calories by the number of meals: 
MEN: 
Average optimal caloric intake for fat loss = 2,300 
Desired number of meals = 5 or 6 
Target calorie intake per meal = 380 to 460 calories 
WOMEN: 
Average optimal caloric intake for fat loss = 1,600 
Desired number of meals = 4 or 5 
Target calorie intake per meal = 320 to 400 calories 
As you can see, these are fairly small meals. Just for fun, let‘s compare this with the calories in 
some meals you might see on restaurant menus: 
Spaghetti with tomato sauce, restaurant serving (3½ cups) = 850 calories 
Big Mac and large fries = 980 calories 
IHOP hearty ham and cheese omelette = 1,000 calories 
Denny’s Grand Slam breakfast = 1,100 calories 
Movie theater popcorn (medium-size) with butter = 1,100 calories 
Porterhouse steak, restaurant-size serving (1 pound) = 1,150 calories 

================================================================================
Five Guys large french fries = 1,314 calories 
Kung Pao chicken with rice (1 order) = 1,620 calories 
Uno Chicago Grill deep dish macaroni & 3-cheese = 1,980 calories 
Cheesecake Factory bistro shrimp pasta = 2,290 calories 
The problem is obvious: Most people, especially in America, have no awareness of calories per 
portion and they‘re massively overeating. A typical restaurant meal, whether we‘re talking about 
steakhouse, diner breakfast, Italian, Chinese, or fast food, can easily top 1,000 calories. If you count 
appetizers, drinks, and/or desserts, it‘s not hard to blow past your entire day‘s calorie quota in one 
sitting! If you want to get leaner, you must choose your meals wisely and control your portion sizes, 
especially at restaurants. 
The simplest and easiest way to split up your daily calories is to divide them evenly between each 
meal. However, there are some adjustments you could make to your meal sizes that might help 
improve your results even more. 
BREAKFAST … STILL FIT FOR KINGS! 
A typical pattern for most dieters is nothing in the morning or a skimpy breakfast like a bagel or 
doughnut, a big lunch like fast-food burgers or cafeteria food, concluding with a huge dinner and, of 
course, the ubiquitous late night snack. By contrast, we usually see most athletes and lean people—
including long-term weight-loss maintainers—consistently eating a hearty breakfast. 
In one study of breakfast eaters, Dr. Holly R. Wyatt of the University of Colorado examined a 
group of formerly overweight subjects in the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR). The NWCR 
was established in 1994 to investigate what makes people successful not just at losing weight but at 
keeping it off. Today the NWCR is the largest ongoing study of successful weight-loss maintainers. 
The average registry member has lost 66 pounds and kept it off for 5.5 years. 
The NWCR research identified some fascinating characteristics associated with successful weight 
maintenance. One of those success behaviors is eating breakfast: 78 percent of registry members 
reported eating breakfast seven days a week, and 90 percent reported eating breakfast on most days of 
the week. Only 3.9 percent of subjects reported never eating breakfast. Breakfast eaters also reported 
higher levels of physical activity. Wyatt and her research team said they found it ―striking‖ that 
breakfast eating was such a frequent behavior among successful maintainers. 
Most of the research on breakfast shows correlations, not cause and effect, and obviously breakfast 
is not an absolute necessity to lose weight. However, research like this does reveal what happens to 
the majority of people who skip breakfast: Hunger and cravings kick in and they‘re more likely to eat 
impulsively later in the day. Breakfast skippers also tend to make poor food choices, which lower the 
nutritional quality for the entire day. ―I don‘t have time‖ is the usual justification, but it‘s an 
unpardonable sin when all you have to do is set your alarm 15 to 20 minutes earlier. 
If the thought of becoming a morning person makes you groan, consider this: In his studies of 
successful people over several decades, personal achievement expert Brian Tracy said, ―I‘ve never 
found any highly successful person who was a late riser.‖ To increase the odds of putting yourself 
among the achievers, get up early, review your goals, prep your meals, and have a nutritious breakfast 
so you‘re well fueled and mentally sharp for the day. 
THE TRUTH ABOUT NIGHTTIME EATING 

================================================================================
Circadian rhythms can affect your hormones, including insulin, cortisol, leptin, growth hormone, and 
thyroid-stimulating hormone, so all kinds of theories have been proposed for eating (or not eating) at 
certain times based on the hormonal response it creates. The real question is: Do any of these short-
term hormone fluctuations affect fat loss in a significant way over time? We don‘t know for sure, but 
if they do, it‘s probably not much compared to the bigger priorities like getting your calories and 
protein right. 
If you stay in a 24-hour calorie deficit, you‘ll lose weight regardless of what time of day you eat. 
It‘s a myth that eating at night makes you fat. It‘s true, however, that night-eating syndrome is a 
clinically significant problem for some people and heavy eating at night is more likely to push the 
average person into a calorie surplus, especially if they‘re not tracking food intake. 
Psychologist John de Castro‘s research at the University of Texas shows that food eaten late at night 
lacks satiating value, which increases intake late in the day, while food eaten in the morning is 
particularly satiating, which reduces calorie intake later in the day. His study concluded: ―A dietary 
regimen that encourages the ingestion of relatively large amounts of food in the morning and restricts 
intake during the evening might reduce overall intake and serve as a treatment or preventative measure 
for obesity.‖ 
Some people eat less at night hoping it will help them control calories and burn more fat. This is 
known as calorie tapering. Recent research has suggested that nighttime protein is beneficial for 
protein synthesis, which has prompted some people to avoid carbs at night, but they still go for a 
protein meal or a bedtime protein shake (casein protein is popular for this purpose). Pulling back on 
the carbs in the evening is appropriately known as carb tapering. 
Calorie or carb tapering has been recommended for years by countless physique athletes and 
coaches and it can be a good strategy for calorie control. However, strict rules such as ―Never eat 
carbs after 7:00 p.m.‖ or ―Don‘t eat within three hours of bedtime,‖ though well-intentioned, are not 
mandatory. Front-loading the calories early in the day probably works best for people who train early 
in the day (with my mid- to late morning workouts, that‘s how I‘ve done it for years). If you train at 
night, you may want to do it the opposite way. 
The basic concept of nutrient timing is to provide more fuel and nutrients when you need them 
most. Good nutrition is a 24-7 discipline and the muscle growth process takes place for many hours 
after training, but you need the most nutritional support around your workouts. Moving some of your 
carb calories to support your training is known as carb targeting, and it‘s the most modern and 
scientifically supported technique. If you train late in the day, you might experiment with moving 
more carb calories to your postworkout meal, even if it‘s in the evening. 
POSTWORKOUT NUTRIENT TIMING 
It‘s important to have one of your protein-containing meals fairly soon after resistance training, 
because this is an important time for muscle recovery and growth. 
Many experts have created formulas to help you calculate the exact calorie, protein, and 
carbohydrate amounts for your postworkout meal. In the Journal of the International Society of Sports 
Nutrition, Alan Aragon and Brad Schoenfeld analyzed all the scientific literature and recommended a 
―simple, relatively fail-safe general guideline‖ of 0.4 to 0.5 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram 
of lean body mass (LBM) both before and after exercise. 
With this formula, someone with 70 kilograms of LBM would have between 28 and 35 grams of 
protein in both the pre- and post-exercise meal. If you had more protein than this, there‘s no downside, 
but if you neglected these protein feedings or fell below the recommended amount, you would not 
maximize the anabolic response. 

================================================================================
The amount of carbs in your postworkout meal can vary but should probably be at least equal to the 
protein. The National Strength and Conditioning Association‘s Guide to Sport and Exercise Nutrition 
suggests a minimum of 30 to 40 grams of carbs after weight training, but this number could be much 
higher, depending on your calorie budget, the intensity of your workouts, and whether your goal is fat 
loss, maintenance, or muscle gain. For intensively training athletes pursuing muscle gain, the carb 
amounts could be twice that. For strict fat-loss programs in a calorie deficit, the carbs would stay on 
the lower end of the range. 
Five Postworkout Nutrition Strategies to Boost Muscle Growth and Improve Recovery 
Postworkout nutrition is important, but many people overcomplicate it by micromanaging 
macronutrients and obsessing over the timing. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle makes it simple with 
five easy guidelines: 
1.  Eat soon after resistance training. The 45 to 60 minutes immediately after intense training is 
an important window when proper nutrition makes the biggest difference. If you ate a 
preworkout meal, there‘s less urgency to eat your postworkout meal immediately, but it‘s a no-
brainer, number one strategy to eat within an hour or sooner after you train. 
2.  Eat protein and carbs in the postworkout meal. Protein is an important part of your 
postworkout meal. Scientists are still debating the optimal amounts, especially carbs, but carbs 
and protein together is ideal. 
3.  Eat some of your carb calories in your postworkout meal. Eating carbs after training helps 
restore blood sugar, suppresses cortisol, causes a beneficial spike in insulin (which helps amino 
acids into your muscles when insulin sensitivity is high), and stimulates protein synthesis. The 
carbs you eat after training are used to replenish muscle glycogen and rarely get stored as body 
fat. 
4.  Drink your protein and carbs postworkout if you prefer. Liquids are often recommended for 
postworkout nutrition because they‘re absorbed more quickly than whole foods. If you opt for a 
liquid ―meal,‖ you can use a commercial postworkout drink or make your own. Several studies 
found that milk makes an excellent postworkout drink (add chocolate protein powder for 
―healthy chocolate milk‖). 
5.  Eat simple carbs or high glycemic carbs if you prefer. The postworkout period is a time when 
quickly absorbing carbs are acceptable. Normally, you‘ll keep simple sugars low, but if you‘re 
going to eat them, right after intense and exhaustive workouts is a good time to do it. 
If your primary goal is fat loss and you have the endomorphic body type or carb-intolerant 
metabolic type, you may want to be more cautious about high-sugar postworkout drinks and stick with 
natural food. Whole food gives you micronutrients and fiber, not just calories and carbs, while 
satisfying your appetite better, and these are decided advantages over liquids. 
WHAT ABOUT INTRA-WORKOUT NUTRITION? 
Serious athletes and sophisticated dieters may want to keep their eyes on research regarding intra-
workout (during workout) nutrition, which often comes in liquid form and sometimes includes 

================================================================================
additional amino acids or other nutrients. For most everyday fat-loss seekers, however, it‘s best to 
avoid overanalyzing these details. 
In fact, if someone tries to sell you on the necessity of a special drink during your workout, 
remember that if you have a proper preworkout meal, you‘ll still be digesting it and releasing the 
nutrients into your system during the workout. This makes nutrition during the workout optional. 
THE PREWORKOUT MEAL 
Most people eat their preworkout meal an hour or two before training. The most recent research 
suggests that pre- and postworkout meals should not be separated by more than 3 to 4 hours, assuming 
the weight training workout doesn‘t go longer than 45 to 90 minutes. 
For many people, preworkout meal timing also depends on stomach comfort. If you get nauseated 
working out right after a meal, simply push back your preworkout meal far enough to let your food 
digest comfortably before training. 
It‘s a common belief that the ideal preworkout meal should be high-carb and high-sugar for quick 
energy. Like the postworkout meal, however, protein is most important before resistance training. For 
carbs, it‘s best to stick with your usual natural, slow-burning carbs plus lean protein meal 
combination. Preworkout sugar gives you a short-lived energy boost, but you may crash later, right in 
the middle of your workout. 
If you train at the crack of dawn and can‘t work out comfortably with a big meal sloshing around in 
your stomach, have a light meal, snack, or protein shake as your preworkout feeding (meal one) and 
then eat your big breakfast (meal two) afterward. Doing weight lifting or intense training totally 
fasted, without even providing amino acids, is not optimal. 
THE BRACKETING TECHNIQUE FOR PRE- AND POSTWORKOUT 
NUTRITION 
Many people report fantastic results using the bracketing technique: They handle pre- and 
postworkout nutrition in one fell swoop by surrounding (bracketing) their workouts with two of their 
meals, which are often the largest meals of the day. Even if you prefer lower-carb nutrition, shifting 
your limited amount of daily carbs around (or at least right after) your weight training sessions is one 
of the biggest bang-for-your-buck nutrient-timing strategies you can use. 
QUICK START 
Bracket your workout in between two of your daily meals and make sure each meal contains a 
protein. If it’s easier, use a protein drink. This is one of the simplest and easiest nutrient-timing 
strategies to help you burn more fat and build more muscle. 
SEVEN PLANNING AND PREPARATION TIPS TO MAKE FAT-
BURNING MEAL PLANS EASY 
Eating like a physique athlete or fitness champion does require some discipline until you get used to it 
and it becomes habitual. But with a little planning, preparation, and scheduling, it‘s not as hard as you 
might think. Here are seven tips to help make it easier. 

================================================================================
1. Think of where you’ll be tomorrow and plan your day in advance. 
Motivational speaker Jim Rohn once said, ―Never start your day until you‘ve finished it.‖ This is 
simple but profound advice about time and life management. Always think ahead to the next day and 
schedule your entire day in advance. If you put your ideal day on paper before you start it, you‘ll 
always have a plan and you‘ll never be caught off guard without healthy food. 
2. Schedule a time for each meal and stick to it. 
When you customize your daily meal plans, choose a start time for each meal. Once you establish it, 
make this your permanent time to make habit work for you. If you stay with the same schedule long 
enough, eating at the prescribed time will become an ingrained habit that requires little or no thought. 
Your body will thrive on the regularity and even cue your hunger when mealtime arrives. 
3. Use the meal-splitting technique. 
Dr. Dan Benardot of Georgia State University is a dietician and sports nutritionist to national and 
Olympic champions. As one way to make an athlete‘s eating plan easier, Dr. Benardot recommends 
meal splitting. This allows you to cook just three meals and spread them across six feedings. ―Eat half 
of what you normally have for breakfast, and eat the other half three hours later,‖ says Benardot. ―Do 
the same for lunch and dinner. This will spread out the calories and ensure that you don‘t eat more 
than you‘re currently eating.‖ 
4. Prepare an entire day’s worth of meals every morning or the night before. 
Spontaneity may be nice in some areas of life, but your meal plan shouldn‘t be left to chance. Early 
every morning or each evening (the night before), cook your food and pack it in plastic containers, bag 
it, or wrap it in foil so that it‘s ready to take with you wherever you go. If you eat at restaurants or 
cafeterias, decide in advance exactly where you‘re going and what you‘ll eat when you get there. 
5. Cook in bulk. 
A huge time-saving strategy is to cook large quantities of food for several days or even a week in 
advance and keep it refrigerated or frozen until you need it. Some people cook a whole turkey on 
Sunday, then slice off portions as needed every day. You can easily prepare large batches of lean 
meats on a George Foreman grill, a jumbo grill pan, or an outdoor barbecue. Boil eggs in quantity and 
refrigerate them (they make a great portable protein snack!). Many of your carbohydrate sources, such 
as potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, and brown rice, can also be cooked in bulk. Crock-Pots and rice 
cookers are standard features in many Burn the Fat kitchens. 
6. Keep your kitchen and refrigerator well stocked with healthy foods. 
If your kitchen isn‘t well stocked with healthy food, you‘ll be more likely to call for fast food or buy 
convenience foods on impulse. Plan your food shopping in advance, preferably setting aside the same 
day every week. (Many people choose Sunday so they‘re prepared for the busy work week ahead.) 
Better still, and especially if you‘re a busy executive or professional, hire a personal assistant to shop 
for you, order groceries online, or use a home delivery service. Never stockpile junk in anticipation of 
cheat meals. When it comes time for a cheat meal, make sure you have to go out of your way to get it. 
If it‘s not in your house every day, you won‘t eat it every day. 

================================================================================
7. Plan ahead when traveling. 
Being in hotels, on the road, or in a plane is no excuse to let your nutrition plan fall apart. All it takes 
is a little planning. If you book yourself into a hotel with a full kitchen and hit the grocery store, then 
your food preparation is business as usual. Road trip? No problem. Cook in advance and get a small, 
portable cooler. It also makes life easier when you think in terms of ―portable foods.‖ You can make 
tuna or turkey sandwiches or wraps using 100 percent whole grain bread; they don‘t need to be 
refrigerated and are easy to eat on the go. Or try this amazing recipe, one of the all-time Burn the Fat, 
Feed the Muscle favorites: 
Apple-Cinnamon High-Protein Oatmeal Pancakes 
INGREDIENTS 
¾ cup oatmeal 
1 whole egg 
3 egg whites 
1 scoop vanilla protein powder 
half an apple, chopped 
dash of cinnamon 
noncaloric sweetener (optional) 
Mix the ingredients in a bowl until they are a thick pancake-batter-like consistency. Lightly coat 
a frying pan with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the mixture into the pan and cook on medium 
until one side is lightly browned. Flip the pancake over until the other side is done. Presto! Eat it 
hot or wrap it in foil and take it with you for a super-convenient, fully portable 400-calorie travel 
meal. 
HOW SNACKING FITS IN 
Most people‘s snacks of choice are refined carbs and fatty foods such as crackers, cookies, candy, 
muffins, pastries, potato chips, and pretzels. This is mainly because packaged convenience foods and 
―carb snacks‖ are so readily available. (It‘s not like you can grab a chicken breast or salmon steak at 
the checkout counter of every convenience store.) 
When you follow the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle meal plan, you won‘t need snacks because 
you‘ll be eating every few hours, so serious hunger and cravings between meals will be a thing of the 
past. However, if you choose a traditional three-meal schedule of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I 
recommend planning healthy snacks for between meals: for example, one mid-morning, one mid-
afternoon, and an optional evening snack (or bedtime protein shake). This way, you‘re still getting 
four to six feedings per day, but only three of them are sit-down meals that require cooking or food 
preparation. Even busy people can manage this with ease. 
A man with a 2,300-calorie-per-day target might split that into three meals of 550 to 600 calories 
each and three snacks of about 200 to 225 calories each. A woman with a daily calorie goal of 1,600 
calories might go with three meals of about 425 to 450 calories each and two snacks of about 125 to 
150 calories each. Postworkout drinks, meal replacements, and protein shakes can be counted as 
snacks or a ―liquid meals,‖ depending on how many calories they have. 

================================================================================
Some snack ideas include raw vegetables (carrots, broccoli, celery, cherry tomatoes, cauliflower, 
etc.), fruit (all kinds, but beware of the high calories in dried fruits), nuts and seeds (in small 
quantities, within your calorie limits), nonfat or low-fat cottage cheese, nonfat or low-fat cheese, 
nonfat or low-fat yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, sardines and other canned fish, and protein shakes. 
SHOULD YOU USE MEAL REPLACEMENTS AND PROTEIN 
DRINKS? 
Work, school, or family commitments can make it hard for some people to fit in all their meals. In 
some business or personal situations, it‘s not appropriate to open up a plastic container and take a 20-
minute break for sweet potato, vegetables, and salmon in the middle of the afternoon just because it‘s 
time for meal four. Whole foods should be your first choice, but in a time crunch, a meal replacement 
product (MRP) can be the difference between following your plan or not. 
MRPs are usually high in protein and come as powder in tubs, cans, or individual packets. You 
simply shake or stir it in water (or milk if you have the calories to spare) or blend it up into a 
smoothie. Don‘t go overboard with shakes, however. These products are supplements, not a 
replacement for good eating habits. The primary advantage of meal replacement shakes over whole 
food is convenience. 
WHAT TO EAT WHEN YOU DON’T HAVE A MEAL READY 
In a pinch, most people reach for carbohydrate snacks, usually high in refined sugars. By contrast, if 
you look at the habits of bodybuilders and fitness pros, you‘ll notice something very interesting: They 
reach for protein. Eating protein by itself (without the carbs) may leave you short on calories, but at 
least you‘ll be taking advantage of what is arguably the most important macronutrient during a fat-loss 
program. 
That‘s why it‘s a good idea to keep some protein powder or a high-protein MRP handy in case of a 
―nutritional emergency.‖ Keep some in your desk, in your car, and in your backpack, briefcase, or 
handbag. Get a shaker bottle and fill it with two or three scoops of protein powder. Bring along a 
bottle of water and then you‘re ready to mix yourself a protein shake anytime, anyplace. Add a piece 
of fruit if you need the carbs. Two minutes and you‘re done. 
What about protein bars? Many so-called nutrition bars are a compromise at best and candy in 
disguise at worst. Read labels carefully. You‘re likely to find refined sugars, corn syrup, trans-fatty 
acids, and other artificial ingredients. Some are also very calorie dense for their small size and not 
very filling. If you can find bars high in protein and made with mostly natural ingredients (or make 
your own protein bars), they can make good snacks for travel and convenience. 
If there‘s a health food store or a smoothie bar nearby, you could pop in for a quick protein drink to 
tide you over until you get home for your next food meal. What if there‘s nothing but fast-food 
restaurants around? No problem: Grab a grilled chicken salad. A convenience store? Grab a can of 
tuna or salmon; they make them now in foil bags and pop-top lids. Most stores these days carry ready-
to-drink protein shakes and even hard-boiled eggs. Greek yogurt is a popular, quick high-protein 
snack. There‘s always a way when you‘re committed. If getting caught without food happens to you a 
lot, you need to spend more time planning your schedule and preparing food in advance. 
If you miss a meal completely, don‘t stress out. As long as you follow your schedule most of the 
time, you‘ll get great results. Don‘t use missing one meal as an excuse to abandon your schedule for 
the rest of the day. Get back on track with your next meal. That‘s all there is to it. 

================================================================================
ONE UNIVERSAL TRAIT OF ALL PEOPLE WHO GET LEAN AND 
STAY LEAN 
Whatever meal schedule you choose, establish a regular daily pattern, seven days a week. Because 
most people work Monday through Friday, some find it easier to follow their program on weekdays. 
On the weekends, it‘s tempting to sleep in, miss meals, eat at restaurants, stay out late for drinks, have 
an entire cheat day, or fall off your regular schedule. 
Habits are a powerful force if you harness them to your advantage. Whatever behavior you repeat 
on a daily basis, week after week, will become habitual. If you eat haphazardly, apply these principles 
inconsistently, or follow the program five days a week and let it fall apart on weekends, you‘ll never 
establish good habit patterns and you‘ll never get optimal results. One trait shared by every person 
who gets lean and stays lean is consistency. 
BECOME DISCIPLINED AND CONSISTENT AND YOU WILL 
SUCCEED! 
For many experienced fitness enthusiasts, the information in this chapter is not new because nutrient 
timing is common knowledge among the fitness savvy and frequent eating has been the traditional 
approach in bodybuilding for decades. However, it‘s talked about more often than it‘s practiced, 
because it takes discipline to do it! 
When starting Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, most people love it because they have more energy, 
they get to eat more, and they never go hungry. But some say that eating five times a day is a pain in 
the gluteus maximus. Like any new lifestyle change, the longer you do it, the easier it gets. Eventually, 
―feeding the machine‖ like clockwork becomes such a deeply ingrained habit, you won‘t be able to 
imagine doing it any other way. 
Of course, you might think that all this nutrient-timing stuff sounds like too much trouble and you‘d 
rather just eat like the average person: coffee for breakfast, whatever lunch is available, a king-size 
dinner, and then late night munchies. Then again, if you look around and see what kind of shape the 
average person is in, you may find that thought passes—quickly!

CHAPTER 14 
The Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle 
Meal Planning System 
Have a plan. Follow the plan, and you’ll be surprised how successful you can be. Most people don’t 
have a plan. That’s why it’s easy to beat most folks. 
—Paul ―Bear‖ Bryant, University of Alabama football coach 
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: FROM FOODS TO MEALS TO 
MEAL PLANS 
This is where we take all the nutrition knowledge you‘ve learned so far and put it together into a 
practical, actionable plan that you can follow every day. In this chapter, you‘ll learn which foods are 
best for burning fat and which are worst. You‘ll discover a simple formula for combining individual 
foods into fat-burning meals and you‘ll see how to turn individual meals into a daily meal plan. You‘ll 
find out why generic meal plans don‘t work and customized meal plans do. Most important of all, 
you‘ll understand why starting your day without a meal plan is the worst mistake you could make. 
THE SIMPLE CURE FOR EVERY DIET PROBLEM 
I must have heard every reason for why people eat poorly or fall off the diet wagon: 
―I had to eat airline food.‖ 
―I was in the car driving all day.‖ 
―I didn’t have anything else with me.‖ 
―The only place to eat was McDonald’s.‖ 
―I was a guest—it would have been rude to turn down dinner.‖ 
―It was the only thing on the menu.‖ 
―I couldn’t help myself—I had a major craving.‖ 
―I was starving—I had to eat something.‖ 
The truth is there are no good reasons for poor food choices, only excuses, because planning is the 
simple cure that solves every diet problem. 
A meal plan is your eating goal for the day. Without goals, you wander aimlessly or float wherever 
the current of life takes you, and in the case of eating, for most people, that‘s right to the nearest fast 
food joint. Without planning, you leave yourself at the mercy of impulse and circumstance. Even 
worse, eating haphazardly makes it impossible to establish a baseline, so you can‘t track your weekly 
progress or troubleshoot problems. 

================================================================================
As simple as it seems, having a meal plan on paper is one of the most powerful fat-burning 
strategies you can use. It‘s a core principle of Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle. 
GRADING YOUR FOOD CHOICES 
Meal plans start on the individual food level, but it can get confusing to know what to eat every day, 
so let‘s start there first. 
We often use the words ―good foods‖ and ―bad foods‖ as figures of speech, but in reality food 
doesn‘t fall neatly into these two categories. Although some foods may deserve their bad reputations, 
a better way to rate whether a food is good or bad is based on dose and context. A small, infrequent 
dose of ice cream never made anyone fat. A large dose every night has. It‘s also helpful to think of 
food quality like temperature or color, with good and bad as simply two ends of a spectrum, not an 
either/or distinction. 
An easy way to start making better decisions is to give your food a grade. Simply ask yourself, 
―How processed is this? How calorie dense is this?‖ The more a food is processed and the more 
calorie dense a processed food is, the lower the grade. The less a food is processed (the closer it is to 
its natural state), the higher the grade. Salmon, broccoli, and a sweet potato are A+ foods, making an 
A+ meal. A cheeseburger, fries, and milk shake get an F. 
You don‘t need straight A‘s to pass. As long as you choose mostly A and B foods—even an 
occasional C—and you‘re conscious of portion sizes, you can feel confident that your meal plan is 
healthy as well as effective for fat loss. There are, however, some danger foods (the D‘s and F‘s) to 
avoid. No foods or food groups are completely forbidden in this program. But if you want the best 
results possible—better body composition and better health—highly processed and fattening foods 
should not be staples in your daily meal plan. 
ARE SOME FOODS REALLY MORE FATTENING THAN OTHERS? 
You could argue that foods aren‘t fattening, excess calories are. But you‘re far more likely to overeat 
some foods than others. These are foods with more calories per unit of volume (high calorie density). 
Certain foods are also more palatable. Did you ever notice how some snack foods make it almost 
impossible to eat just one? How easily does ice cream go down? (If it weren‘t for the ―brain freeze,‖ 
most people would probably scarf it down even faster.) So if we‘re talking about calorie density or 
ease of consumption, then fattening foods definitely exist. 
Certain food combinations are doubly disastrous. Fat and sugar is one of the worst. Common 
examples include cheesecake, peanut butter cups, and ice cream. Starchy carbs plus fat is another 
dangerous combo. A prime example is white pasta with a cheesy, creamy, or buttery sauce (think 
fettuccine Alfredo). A typical restaurant serving is about 1,200 calories. Cheese fries are notorious in 
this category: potatoes (starchy carb) fried in oil (fat), topped with full-fat cheese rocket the calories to 
a stratospheric 2,000 or more per plate. 
Even healthy, unprocessed foods can become calorie bombs, depending on what you put on them. 
Salads can be a great starter or even a complete meal (if you include some lean protein), but when 
they‘re topped with full-fat cheeses, croutons, bacon bits, and high-fat dressings, they pack a caloric 
wallop. Dry baked potatoes are a good, natural starchy carb choice, but when loaded with bacon bits, 
cheese, or sour cream, the calories can double. 
Frequent or unrestrained eating of fat-storing foods, especially combined with caloric drinks, can 
stuff you with thousands of surplus calories. Have you ever seen the math equation for a weekend 

================================================================================
binge? It‘s 5 ‒ 2 = 0. That‘s five days of perfect eating minus two nights at the bars and restaurants 
equals zero results for the entire week. Back to square one on Monday. 
THE 12 WORST FAT-STORING FOODS 
One of the best ways to start the meal planning process is to learn which foods to keep out of your 
daily meal plans. Then your odds of choosing the most nutritious foods are automatically higher. 
The Terrible 12 
• French fries and other deep-fried foods 
• Ice cream and milk shakes 
• Doughnuts and pastries 
• Candy and confections 
• Sugar-sweetened soft drinks 
• Sugar-sweetened juice drinks, energy drinks, teas, and dessert coffees 
• White bread and white flour products 
• Potato chips, corn chips, and fried tortilla chips 
• Bacon, sausage, and processed lunch meats 
• Hot dogs and fast-food burgers 
• Pizza with thick crusts and fatty meat toppings 
• Sugary breakfast cereals 
If you‘re in tears right now because I just took away all of your favorite foods, don‘t worry. No 
foods are totally forbidden. For cheat meals—which you can work right into your plan—eat anything 
you want. In fact, cheat meals and re-feeds can have positive effects in physical and psychological 
ways—if they‘re used strategically and kept under control. What you eat occasionally has little impact 
on your health or body composition. What you eat every day is what matters the most. Take it 
seriously. 
By eating as many of your daily calories as possible from natural, nutrient-dense food, you‘re doing 
more than losing weight: You‘re building health. You‘re also building self-discipline and gaining 
momentum. Every time you eat a healthy meal, you get the same good feeling you get after a great 
workout; it‘s like an endorphin rush. You pat yourself on the back and say, ―Job well done.‖ You 
build the confidence of a person who has a goal and is going after it, who has a plan and follows it. 
Eating the same healthy foods every day also taps into the power of habit. Any behavior you repeat 
daily becomes habitual and eventually effortless. Willpower can only take you so far. The best way to 
harness the power of positive habits is to follow a well-structured meal plan until it becomes second 
nature. Building meal plans starts with choosing healthy, fat-burning foods. 
THE 12 BEST FAT-BURNING FOODS 
Like ―fattening foods,‖ the term ―fat-burning foods‖ may be a misnomer because all foods add 
calories to your energy balance sheet; they don‘t subtract them. Some foods have a very low calorie 

================================================================================
density, but there‘s no such thing as negative-calorie foods that take more calories to digest than they 
contain. Clearly, however, certain foods are better for fat loss than others, for a variety of reasons. 
Lean protein foods have the highest thermic effect and suppress your appetite better than any other 
macronutrient. This is one of the many reasons you include a lean protein with every meal. Fibrous 
vegetables are always a superb choice because they‘re high in fiber and low in calories. The most ―fat 
burning‖ of all meals is lean protein plus fibrous carbs (fish and broccoli or chicken and a green salad, 
for example). 
Whole fruits and natural, high-fiber starchy carbs are also good choices, although you must control 
the starchy carb quantities to keep your calorie deficit. The amount of starchy carbs in a meal plan can 
vary a lot, depending on your goals. Accelerated fat-loss or competition-level diets usually include 
fewer starchy carbs. But overall, these are the staple foods that make up the foundation of the program 
for most people. 
The Terrific 12 
✓ Whole fresh fruit 
✓ Vegetables (any fibrous carb or nonstarchy vegetable) 
✓ Yams (or sweet potatoes) 
✓ Potatoes 
✓ Oatmeal, rolled or steel-cut (unsweetened) 
✓ Brown rice 
✓ Beans and legumes 
✓ 100% whole wheat or whole grains* 
✓ Low- or nonfat dairy products* 
✓ Chicken and turkey breast 
✓ Eggs and egg whites 
✓ Lean cuts of red meat, game meats 
*If you have allergies or intolerances, you may need to avoid certain foods, such as dairy or grains. 
This short and simple food list might be one of the most valuable resources in the book, so you‘ll 
want to keep it handy. Brian, a Burn the Fat reader who shed 127 pounds of fat, told me, ―At first I 
just wanted to know what to eat. I figured, if eating these foods worked that well for bodybuilders, 
then I wanted to try it myself. Following the 12 fat-burning foods list alone is what got me started.‖ 
Many other readers have shared similar stories: Kick-starting your fat loss can be as simple as 
following a list of foods to eat every day. 
By the way, this is the same list of foods you‘d use for gaining muscle as well. The difference is in 
the amounts. As you learned in Chapter 7 when we talked about calories, to gain muscle, you have to 
eat in a surplus: same foods, but more of them. 
QUICK START 

================================================================================
Many Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle readers who lost over 100 pounds started their body 
transformation journey simply by eating the foods recommended on the 12 best fat-burning 
foods list and avoiding the 12 worst fat-storing foods. 
THE SIX EXCHANGE GROUPS AND BURN THE FAT, FEED THE 
MUSCLE FOOD LIST 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle makes more precise distinctions about food groups than most diets. We 
subdivide carbs into starchy, fibrous, and simple. Proteins are narrowed down into lean proteins, 
because we usually don‘t want the extra fat calories (with some exceptions, such as fatty fish). Dairy 
products are narrowed down to non- or low-fat (to save calories), and fats have their own category. 
That makes six food groups, and the foods within each group can be exchanged.

THE BURN THE FAT, FEED THE MUSCLE MEAL BUILDER: A 
SIMPLE TEMPLATE FOR CREATING FAT-BURNING MEALS 
Once you‘re familiar with the highest-quality foods and you understand the different food groups, the 
next step is to pick the foods you like and put them together into your own customized meals. The 
classic bodybuilder‘s meal is a lean protein, a starchy carb, and a fibrous carb. Here‘s the template: 
Step 1: Choose a lean protein for every meal. 
Step 2: Choose a starchy carb for every meal. 
Step 3: Choose a fibrous carb for every meal. 
Step 4: Add healthy fats into some meals as needed to reach your daily goal. 
It doesn‘t get much simpler. As long as you understand which foods are lean proteins, starchy carbs, 
and fibrous carbs, it‘s as easy as one, two, three. Even if you don‘t track your macronutrients by the 
numbers, if you follow this template for most of your meals, your numbers will be in the ballpark. 
Think of all our templates for meals and daily meal plans as easy starting points and guidelines, not 
as commandments carved in stone. Later in the chapter, I‘ll show you some alternate templates and 
ways to customize daily meal plans. For now, here are a few ways you can modify the meal template 
to suit your preferences. 
1.  Swap fruit for fibrous carbs. Some people eat vegetables for breakfast (veggie omelets, for 
example), but fruit is a popular breakfast food, so in the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle meal 
template, you can swap fibrous carbs for fruit if you choose. Fruit doesn‘t have its own slot in 
this template, but I encourage you to include fruit in your meal plans. 
2.  Swap fruit for starchy carbs. Although fruits have fiber, most fruits also have a substantial 
amount of metabolizable carbohydrate calories, so fruits make a suitable exchange for starchy 
carbs at times. For example, in a meal of eggs, spinach, and oatmeal, you could drop the oatmeal 
and have fruit instead. If you need to keep your calories low or you want a very simple meal, 
another option is a lean protein and fruit (for example, hard-boiled eggs and a banana). 
3.  Dairy products are optional. Lactose intolerance is common and some people don‘t want to 
use dairy for other reasons. An advantage of including dairy foods is that they‘re a source of 
high-quality protein. There‘s not as much protein in most servings of dairy as there is in lean 

================================================================================
meat, fish, or eggs. But foods such as Greek yogurt and nonfat cottage cheese give you enough 
to count it as a lean protein in our meal template. 
4.  For variety, eat more than one fibrous or starchy carb per meal. As long as you stay within 
your calorie and macronutrient target ranges, you can have more than one of each natural carb if 
you choose. For example, broccoli and cauliflower (two fibrous carbs), or rice and beans (two 
starchy carbs). 
Burn the Fat, Feed The Muscle Meal Ideas: Breakfast 
The first step in creating a breakfast is to select a lean protein; eggs are the classic choice. Using egg 
whites can help you get more protein while controlling the calories. But including at least one whole 
egg in your egg meals provides valuable nutrients from the yolk, and the whole egg is more filling 
than the whites alone. The second step is to choose a starchy carb such as oatmeal or a 100 percent 
whole grain bread or cereal. The third step is to choose a fibrous carb such as veggies for an omelet, or 
have fruit instead. Walnuts or ground flaxseed are also popular additions to oatmeal. 
There‘s no reason you can‘t have vegetables and fish for breakfast if that‘s what you want. But a 
more traditional breakfast usually includes either hot cereal, cold cereal, or whole grain bread for 
complex carbs; a piece of fruit for simple carbs; and eggs, protein powder, or a dairy product for 
protein. Be careful with cold cereals: Most of them are processed and filled with sugar, which is one 
reason why hot old-fashioned rolled or steel-cut oatmeal is so popular on this plan. If you want it 
sweeter, try it with berries or natural applesauce. 
If you‘re looking for easy ways to eat more vegetables, put them into your omelets and scrambles. 
Spinach and mushroom omelets are a low-carb favorite. Bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes are also 
great for egg recipes. Potatoes go well with eggs when you have room for more starchy carbs. For 
Mexican eggs, add salsa (and low-fat cheese if you have room for the calories). For a Greek omelet, 
try spinach, feta cheese, and olives. 
Yogurt or cottage cheese and fruit is a popular light, quick breakfast or mid-morning snack. Protein 
smoothies with fruit are also great in the morning or anytime you‘re in a hurry. Rolled oats can also be 
added as a whole food ingredient in a protein drink; that‘s been a hotel room breakfast for me many 
times (cheaper than the restaurant too).

Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle Meal Ideas: Lunch and Dinner 
As with all meals, for lunch or dinner, you begin by choosing a lean protein such as chicken breast, 
lean beef, or fish. Second, you choose a starchy carb such as brown rice, yam, or potato. Third, choose

Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle Template for Creating Daily Meal Plans 
You can use a template for daily meal plans just as you did for individual meals. Using templates 
makes everything ―plug-and-play‖ easy and allows unlimited variety. All you have to do is choose the 
foods and plug them into the slots. The baseline nutrition template is where most people start. The 
accelerated fat-loss (―competition diet‖) templates, which have fewer starchy carbs and more protein, 
are the next level; we‘ll cover that in the final chapter.

p.m.; meal 5—9:30 p.m. 
Women who are short and small framed, who don‘t have a large calorie budget, might opt for the four-meal plan or the three-meals-
with-snacks plan. 
To make sure your calorie and macro numbers are on target, add up your meal subtotals and your 
daily meal plan totals. Then increase or decrease the serving sizes so you‘re close to your calorie and 
macronutrient goals. If you want the most precision, use a spreadsheet, app, or nutrition software. You 
can download a free interactive meal planner Excel sheet at www.BurnTheFatFeedTheMuscle.com. 
Some people find making daily meal plans challenging at first, but usually only because they‘re 
trying too hard to micromanage their macronutrients. Remember, macronutrient ratios don‘t have to 
be perfect. If you stick close to this template, the macros will fall right into the ballpark. After your 
initial setup, you‘ll simply need to adjust the serving sizes to get close to your calorie target. 

================================================================================
Schedule a time for each meal, because those mealtimes will become habitual. If you have an 
unorthodox schedule, don‘t worry that you‘re not eating when most other people are eating; eat at 
your own times, but make it a regular schedule. Your body thrives on regularity, so avoid random or 
haphazard eating. 
The old rule was that you must eat six times per day, or every three hours. This is the approach that 
I use and that helped me win more than two dozen trophies in natural bodybuilding championships. 
There‘s no question about how well it works, especially for building muscle. But nowhere is this 
carved in stone. Many people adopted it simply because it has been the most popular meal plan in the 
physique world. 
There has, however, been a shift in recent years toward greater flexibility in meal schedules to 
accommodate goals, personal preference, and metabolic individuality. Even among fitness athletes, 
today you‘ll see some choose fewer meals if they are small bodied, less active, and pursing weight 
loss, while others spread their calories into more meals if they are large, active, and pursuing muscle 
gains. This customized approach makes more sense than any rigid, prescribed plan, which leans in one 
direction or the other. 
CUSTOMIZING YOUR DAILY MEAL PLANS 
The modern style of bodybuilding nutrition we use in Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is so flexible that 
anyone can do it. Eating anywhere from four to six times per day fits into our basic template, and 
every meal doesn‘t need to be a formal sit-down affair that requires food prep and cooking. There are 
many solutions for customizing your meal plan to make it fast, easy, and convenient. Here are three of 
them: 
1.  Include snacks in your daily meal plan. Most people already eat at least four or five times per 
day, they‘re simply not eating the right foods and they don‘t have any structure; they grab 
snacks at random between meals or on impulse at night. Instead of snacking carelessly on junk 
food, build snacks strategically into your schedule and, if possible, include protein in most of 
them. If you eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner and include two or three snacks in between, you‘re 
eating five or six times. There you have it: You‘re feeding the muscle and eating like the leanest, 
fittest people in the world. 
2.  Make a shake or smoothie for one of your meals. Protein drinks and meal replacement shakes 
are a big help to many people—and I‘m not saying that because I sell them. I have no 
affiliations with the protein supplement industry. I recommend getting the majority of your 
calories and nutrients from whole foods. I mention shakes simply because they solve the 
convenience problem for many people while simultaneously helping you reach that important 
protein goal. When you‘re in a hurry, drink a meal instead of eating it. If you get creative with 
smoothie recipes, you can also boost the nutritional value of your drinks by adding whole food 
ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, oats, flaxseeds, nut butters, and so on. If your shakes taste 
good, it makes compliance easier too. 
3.  Try a four-meal schedule. Another option for the busy person is the four-meal-a-day plan: 
breakfast in the morning, lunch in the afternoon, dinner in the early evening, and one more meal 
(or a snack/shake) later in the evening. Many people avoided this type of schedule in the past 
because they thought eating at night was not allowed if you want to burn fat. We cleared up that 
misconception in a previous chapter. If you want a nighttime meal, you can, but you must plan 

================================================================================
for it and keep it inside your daily calorie budget. If you train at night, then a big night meal may 
be a great option because it gives you the proper postworkout nutrition. 
If I wrote one set of meal plans and said you had to follow them to the letter, it might create some 
problems. What if you were allergic or intolerant to half the foods? What if you don‘t like some of the 
foods? The fact is I don‘t know what you like to eat. No other diet expert knows, either, without 
consulting you personally. 
There are nutrition principles that everyone must follow, but if you want the best results and the 
most enjoyable experience, the ultimate solution is to customize your meal plans rather than follow 
someone else‘s. Suggested food lists, sample meals, and sample daily meal plans are helpful as idea 
starters, but you should be able to fill in the blanks and make swaps easily. The best news is that all it 
takes to get started is one good meal plan that you enjoy. 
MEAL PLAN VARIETY: WHAT THE LEANEST PEOPLE IN THE 
WORLD DO 
When it comes to the need for variety, everyone is different. But among the leanest people in the 
world, they usually share a unique trait: When they‘re pursuing an important physique goal, most of 
them follow the same meal plan every day. People who‘ve had the greatest success on Burn the Fat, 
Feed the Muscle eat mostly the same thing during the early phases. As time goes by, they swap out 
foods and try new meals whenever they get bored. Most have two or three favorite meal plans—a total 
of 10 to 15 different favorite meals—and they rotate those over and over again. 
Contrary to what many people have been taught, eating the same thing every day or following the 
same meal plan each day can help you automatically eat less and maintain long-term fat loss. 
Behavioral studies have shown that when you‘re given too many choices, you not only become 
confused about what to eat, you also tend to eat more. Eating more or less the same every day also 
turns new behaviors into habits quickly, makes it easy to track calories, and helps you establish a 
baseline sooner, making it a snap to troubleshoot plateaus. 
One caveat: If you‘re like me and you eat mostly the same foods every day, it‘s a good idea to get 
as much within-day variety as possible (make each meal different). There are more than 40 essential 
nutrients you must consume to maintain good health and no food contains all of them. It‘s also a good 
idea to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement for nutritional insurance, especially when you‘re in a 
calorie deficit. 
If you‘re the gets-bored-easily type of eater who demands more variety, exchanging foods is simple 
when you have a template. From your original meal plan, swap the old food for a new food from the 
same category: fibrous carbs for fibrous carbs; lean proteins for lean proteins; and so on. This will 
keep your macronutrient numbers approximately the same. 
For example, if you want to exchange rice, look on the food list for other types of natural starchy 
carbs. You‘ll find yams, baked potatoes, beans, legumes, whole grains, and many other options. The 
possible meal combinations are endless. You‘re not limited to the foods listed in this book, but our 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle food lists will give you a lot of good ideas. 
HOW TO MEASURE AND TRACK YOUR CALORIES AND 
MACRONUTRIENTS 

================================================================================
Weighing food is the most accurate way to track calories and macros, and that‘s why a food scale is a 
prominent appliance in every Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle kitchen. A scale is helpful for weighing 
meat, fish, vegetables, potatoes, and many other foods. If the weight is listed on a package, you can 
eyeball the serving size from that alone. For example, a typical bag of frozen vegetables is 16 ounces, 
so if you want an 8-ounce serving, then use half of the bag. If a package of chicken is 18 ounces and 
you need a 6-ounce serving, simply divide the package into thirds. You can also use measuring cups 
for tracking calories and nutrient values by volume. Oatmeal and cereals are typically measured dry 
and uncooked. Rice and pastas are generally measured after cooking. Keep in mind that some calorie 
counter guides include cooked and uncooked food values. The important thing is to not confuse the 
two. 
With enough repetition of positive habits, making healthy choices and getting your numbers in the 
right ballpark becomes second nature. You won‘t need to count, weigh, and measure everything for 
the rest of your life, unless you want to. But in the early stages, think of counting and tracking as vital 
parts of the learning process. The precision is also helpful when you‘re going after big goals. For 
example, I don‘t weigh and measure my food all year round. After eating this way for years, it‘s 
totally habitual and unconscious for me. But if I want to prep for a competition, you‘d better believe 
I‘ll go back to doing it by the numbers. 
If you never count, weigh, or measure, you‘ll never go through the learning process that allows you 
to become unconsciously competent. You‘ll always be guessing, running blind, and probably 
underestimating your calorie intake badly more often than you think. Give counting and tracking at 
least 28 days, and by then you‘ll already have new habits developing. Give it a few months and you‘ll 
have a real knack for portion sizes, and then, just by estimating, you‘ll have a better idea of 
approximately how many ounces or grams are in any food item. 
HOW TO MAKE NUTRITIOUS FOOD DELICIOUS FOOD 
There‘s a persistent myth about fat-burning nutrition that if it‘s health food, it must taste bad—or the 
flip side, that if something tastes good, you shouldn‘t eat it. Even the fitness legend Jack LaLanne said 
it (one of my idols, so God bless him, even if his well-meaning advice wasn‘t quite accurate). This 
myth was probably perpetuated because many athletes choose to eat very plain and simple diets, 
which makes it easy to prepare the food, follow the plan, and track the numbers. 
The truth is, as long as you hit your calorie and macronutrient goals, you can do as much cooking as 
you want and as much spicing as your taste buds desire. You can enjoy delicious meals every day if 
that‘s important to you. If not, you can keep your meal plans plain and simple. 
Starting with basic, plain meals is simply another part of the learning process. Unless you‘re already 
a food-savvy master chef, the learning curve usually goes like this: 
1.  Familiarize yourself with the best foods and work off a food list. 
2.  Learn how to put together individual foods into meals. 
3.  Move on to fancier, multi-ingredient, multi-step recipes. 
Step three could easily fill up another book (if enough people bug me for a Burn the Fat, Feed the 
Muscle cookbook, we‘ll see about that). For now, I‘ll give you a few tasters (below) that are so easy to 
make, they don‘t require explanation. Also, you should know that you can freely use herbs, spices, and 
seasonings such as black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, oregano, parsley, tarragon, thyme, dill, 

================================================================================
ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, chopped onion, cumin, paprika, and, yes, even a pinch of salt here and 
there. 
You can also add any low- or noncaloric condiments, sauces, lemon juice, light dressings, low-
calorie marinades, rubs, salsa, or noncaloric sweeteners (if you wish to avoid artificial sweeteners, 
stevia is popular and widely available). If you use any condiments that have calories, be sure to add 
those into your meal plan totals because little things forgotten can add up to an ―unexplainable‖ 
plateau over time. 
Sometimes extra virgin olive oil is an essential ingredient in some recipes, but you‘ll save a lot of 
calories by getting away from butter and oil in general. On fat-loss programs, most people don‘t have 
the extra calories to spend. Instead, a light coat of nonstick cooking spray does the trick.

WHY YOU SHOULD ―CHEAT‖ AND MAKE FREE MEALS A PART 
OF YOUR PLAN 
To an athlete, food is fuel, food is building material, and at times great nutritional discipline is 
required to achieve big goals. But food is also one of life‘s great pleasures and an important part of our 
social lives. When you deprive yourself completely, it can make you more likely to binge, crave 
missed foods, and give up. It‘s simply human nature to want what you can‘t have. That‘s why, for 
most people, it‘s better to allow cheat meals. But there‘s a right and wrong way to do it. 
Many diet programs recommend an anything-goes cheat day once a week. That might work for 
some people some of the time, especially when a big cheat day follows a week or more of very strict 
dieting. But while I do recommend strategic re-feed days, I don‘t recommend free-for-all cheat days. 
The former are planned and measured parts of your program. The latter are more like gluttony and can 
easily go too far, break your momentum, and backfire. If you care about your physical and mental 
health, stay away from anything remotely resembling bingeing or a starve-binge cycle. 

================================================================================
Even with cheat meals, the key is planning. The most effective strategy I‘ve used is to stay on a 
meal schedule seven days a week, but enjoy one or two weekly cheat meals as part of the plan. A good 
rule of thumb for most people is the 90 percent compliance rule. That means follow the Burn the Fat, 
Feed the Muscle food lists and eat healthy, natural, nutrient-dense foods 90 percent of the time (90 
percent of your weekly calories or weekly meals). For your cheat meals, eat anything you want and 
lose the ―forbidden foods‖ mentality. 
Consistency is another key. Honoring your compliance rules and staying on a meal schedule are 
hallmarks of all the fittest and leanest people. If you‘re inconsistent, you don‘t allow good habits to 
form and you stay stuck in that horrible cycle of cheat/guilt, binge/starve, and ―start-over Mondays.‖ If 
it‘s a part of your plan, it‘s not really cheating, and if it‘s not cheating, there‘s no reason to feel guilty. 
That‘s why many followers of Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle prefer to call them ―free meals,‖ not 
―cheat meals.‖ 
Most people track the calories in their free meals carefully, but either way, remember that there are 
two kinds of compliance. First, there‘s compliance to a calorie deficit, which is mandatory for weight 
loss. There‘s also compliance to a food list, which is actually more flexible than you might think. I 
know some people who comply with their clean foods list only about 80 percent of the time, but as 
long as they hit their calorie deficit and macronutrient goals, they still get great results. But be careful 
not to get too lax. The lower you drop compliance to your healthy food list, the easier it is to start 
forming bad habits, the lower the nutrient density of your meals, and the unhealthier it gets. 
WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR BEST-LAID PLANS GO ASTRAY 
Life isn‘t always predictable and sometimes things happen that interfere with even the best of plans. 
But there‘s a solution for unexpected events: plan B, the plan for when you can‘t follow your plan. 
First, remind yourself that there‘s no reason to get upset or frustrated just because you miss a meal 
or can‘t have an ideal meal. Most people beat themselves up mentally and emotionally after a single 
slipup (perfectionist thinking). Even worse, some equate a single mistake with absolute failure, as if 
one bad meal ruins an entire day or one bad day ruins an entire month (all-or-nothing thinking). One 
meal doesn‘t make or break you. Your habits make or break you. It‘s what you do every day, over and 
over, week after week, that matters the most. 
Second, remind yourself that you always have choices. Then make the best choice possible in every 
situation. Even at a fast-food restaurant, you have choices. You can have grilled chicken and water 
instead of the double bacon cheeseburger and soda. Even when only one type of food is being served, 
you still have a choice. You can choose how much food you eat. The calorie quality might be poor, but 
if you choose a smaller serving and get the calorie quantity right, at least you‘re obeying the law of 
energy balance and you won‘t get fatter. 
NOW CREATE A PLAN AND COMMIT TO IT! 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is the next generation of fat-burning and muscle-building nutrition 
programs—structured, by-the-numbers, but also more flexible than any conventional diet. Whether 
you‘re as disciplined as an athlete or you customize your plan to suit a more relaxed lifestyle, you 
must have a plan. Don‘t try to wing it. You can‘t ―intuitively‖ eat properly from day one without 
educating yourself about food and developing a meal plan. The opposite is true: Proper eating gets 
turned over to your subconscious (i.e., becomes habit) only after you do the work and go through the 
conscious stages of the learning process first. 

================================================================================
In our modern obesogenic environment—with social pressure, food marketing, eating cues tempting 
us at every turn, and technology making us more and more sedentary—being able to successfully 
guesstimate your nutrition or trust your innate feelings of hunger and satiety are not things that come 
naturally or easily. The surefire way to make eating well become second nature is by going through a 
learning process, and that includes setting goals, crunching numbers, planning meals, tracking food, 
and measuring progress. Then repeat. That is how you achieve unconscious competence and mastery. 
It takes time to make changes in your daily eating habits and make those changes stick. There‘s no 
quick fix, but this chapter was loaded with little tips and tricks that you can start implementing not 
next week, not tomorrow, but today. As General George S. Patton said, ―A good plan … executed 
now, is better than a perfect plan next week.‖ So create your first meal plan, keep it where you can see 
it—as you do with all your goals—and get to it! 
ACTIVATE: 
CARDIO TRAINING (The 3
rd Element) 
Did you ever wonder why so many people fail to burn the fat off or keep the fat off by dieting? It‘s because that‘s all they do—
diet! Eating less without moving isn‘t going to cut it. You must get active! 
Good nutrition alone can get weight loss started and improve your health, but there‘s one thing eating right can‘t do: It won‘t 
make you fitter. Why settle for leaner and healthier when you can get leaner, healthier, and fitter? How would you like more 
endurance, more energy, and a natural endorphin ―high‖ as bonuses? You get all that when you add cardio training into the mix. 
The benefits don‘t end there. Why settle for getting leaner when you can get leaner faster? That‘s what else cardio training 
does for you. You can only cut calories so far. Why work on only one side of the fat-burning equation when you can work on both 
sides—with cardio—and burn fat faster? 
Wait, it gets even better. Burning fat off is only half the battle. Keeping fat off is the other half, and for most people, it‘s the 
toughest fight to win. That‘s the one solution that all the experts agree on: Getting active and staying active is the key to lifelong 
maintenance. 
Before you jump to it, here‘s a piece of advice to help you be absolutely sure you get permanent results. As you read through 
the chapter on cardio training, you‘ll see that there‘s no single best type of cardio. There‘s no one exercise that I force you to do. 
You get to customize your own plan, and your choices are endless. 
The real key to success is to find an exercise you enjoy—then it won‘t even seem like work. You‘ll start to look forward to 
training, and when that happens, you‘ve got it made: You‘re on your way to getting healthier, leaner, and fitter—for life! 
CHAPTER 15 
Maximize Your Fat Loss 
with Cardio Training 

================================================================================
To lose fat, you need to create a calorie deficit. This can be done using high- or low-intensity exercise. 
In other words, the best exercise for weight loss is to burn as many calories as you can in the time you 
have available. 
—Christian Finn, MS, founder of Muscle EVO (muscleevo.net) 
THE AMAZING BENEFITS OF CARDIO 
If you know the secrets, cardio can be the number one key to accelerating your fat loss beyond what 
you could achieve with diet alone. If you do cardio right, you could double or even triple your rate of 
fat loss, boost your metabolism, increase your conditioning to an athlete‘s level, and get healthier than 
you‘ve ever been. If you do it wrong, you will waste time and suffer consequences such as muscle 
loss, metabolic adaptation, joint pain, boredom, and burnout. 
Enjoying the positives of cardio without the negatives is all about intelligently integrating cardio 
with nutrition, fine-tuning the balance between intensity, duration, and frequency, and choosing the 
right cardio program for your goals, your body type, and your lifestyle. This chapter will show you 
how. 
EXERCISE OR NUTRITION: WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR 
FAT LOSS? 
Even if you ask top personal trainers, whose entire careers are devoted to preaching the benefits of 
exercise, almost all will concede that the priority for fat-loss success is nutrition, not training. There 
are two major reasons for this. 
First, it‘s easier to create the initial calorie deficit by decreasing your food intake. If you are 
maintaining your weight and you eat 500 fewer calories every day—even if you did nothing else—
you‘ll start losing weight. Yes, without the slightest physical exertion. If you are smart, however, you 
won‘t stop there, because as important as it is, nutrition is only one piece of a complete fitness 
program. 
Second, it‘s not only possible, it‘s easy to outeat any amount of exercise if you‘re not watching your 
balance between calories burned and calories consumed. Trainers are constantly frustrated when their 
clients leave the gym and proceed to destroy all the hard work they did … with a fork and a knife! 
Sometimes they cancel an entire workout‘s calorie burn with one visit to the coffee and doughnut 
shop. 
If you think, ―There‘s no way I could eat so much that it would undo all my training,‖ think again. 
Lean endurance athletes are a perfect example. They might burn as many as 5,000 calories a day 
biking, swimming, or running, but they don‘t lose weight. How is that possible? Simple: They put all 
those calories back—on purpose—to match their training demand. People who want to lose weight 
often do the same thing: They train like crazy, but they put all the calories back. The difference is they 
do it accidentally. They don‘t lose weight either. Oops! 
This is why so many so-called experts believe that exercise doesn‘t work for weight loss. They 
claim that people compensate by eating too much after starting an exercise program, replacing the 
extra calories they burned. ―Well, no kidding!‖ I yell at them. ―Don‘t put all the calories back! It‘s 
called dietary restraint!‖ Working out isn‘t a free pass to eat as much as you want. 

================================================================================
THE ULTIMATE SECRET TO FAT LOSS 
The secret to fat loss is so simple, it‘s a tragedy that it hasn‘t clicked yet for the millions of people 
struggling with excess body fat. Read the following paragraph as many times as you need to until you 
get it. Understanding this distinction is the key to it all. 
The secret to fat loss is not exercise. It‘s not what foods you eat either. The ultimate secret to fat 
loss is achieving a calorie deficit, and consistently staying in that deficit until you reach your goal. 
Nutrition is only one way to achieve the deficit: You decrease calories in. Training is the other way: 
You increase calories out. 
Your gut reaction on reading this may be ―It can‘t be that simple: We‘ve heard ‗Eat less and 
exercise more‘ for years and it hasn‘t solved the problem.‖ I agree. I didn‘t say eating less and 
exercising more is the secret. I said maintaining a calorie deficit is the secret. Exercising more is a 
poor crutch for a bad diet or ignorance of calorie math. Training more to increase a deficit, on the 
other hand, accelerates fat loss every time. 
Focus on the deficit. It‘s a simple concept on paper, but not easy to manage in the real world. It 
takes knowledge, awareness, diligence, discipline, honesty, and consistency. The good news is, when 
you get it intellectually and then you apply it, you‘ll gain total control of your body and you‘ll never 
have to worry about body fat again. 
THE FINAL NAILS IN THE COFFIN FOR DIET WITHOUT 
EXERCISE 
If nutrition gets ranked as the most important element for fat loss and you can lose weight with diet 
alone, then why bother training? Why not just cut calories and save yourself a lot of time and sweat? 
This is not an unreasonable question. My answer is: If you burn the fat with training, you get better 
body composition, better health, and better fitness than if you starve the fat with diet alone. You can 
also get results faster. 
If you have a 500-calorie daily deficit, and you want to accelerate fat loss, increase it to 750 or 
1,000. One way to do this is by decreasing your food intake more, but you can cut only so many 
calories until you‘re starving and bad stuff starts to happen. That leaves cardio training—on the ―burn 
more‖ side of the equation—as the prime method for increasing your deficit. 
If there are two sides to the energy balance equation—food in versus calories burned—then 
working only on the food intake side is like going into a fistfight with one hand tied behind your back. 
You could fight one-handed, but why would you want to? You‘ll be at a disadvantage. You can lose 
weight without training, but without some type of vigorous physical work, you‘ll never burn fat at the 
maximum possible rate. 
Exercise is also crucial for keeping the fat off. There‘s so much research backing up this point, even 
experts who promote only dieting for weight loss admit that exercise is vital for weight maintenance. 
Simply eating less does nothing to make you stronger, fitter, or more athletic. Diets can actually 
make you a smaller version of your old self—weighing less, but still flabby and weak. If you want 
only a smaller pants size, you can achieve it by dieting. If you want a new body that‘s lean, muscular, 
and looks as good out of clothes as it does in clothes, training is mandatory. 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTIVITY AND TRAINING 

================================================================================
All physical activity counts. Even yard work, walking around town doing errands, and vacuuming the 
house burns calories. But obviously some activities don‘t burn much or have much effect on carving 
out a muscular body, so we don‘t count them as formal training. 
Your miscellaneous activity is part of NEAT, which, if you recall, is the acronym for non-exercise 
activity thermogenesis. The more you walk and the more activity you get throughout the day, the 
better. It all adds up, and it can nudge along your fat loss nicely over time. But it‘s the formal type of 
training we‘ll focus on, because that‘s what really transforms your body quickly and dramatically. 
In Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, there are two types of formal training, resistance and cardio. Both 
can burn large amounts of calories and help you lose fat, but we‘ll consider them as two separate 
endeavors, with distinctly different purposes. You‘ll focus on weight training for gaining strength, 
building muscle, and reshaping your body. You‘ll focus on cardio training for heart health, 
conditioning, and fat burning. 
WHAT TYPES OF EXERCISE ARE BEST FOR CARDIO TRAINING? 
Our definition of ―cardio‖ is any exercise that‘s rhythmic in nature, involves large muscle groups 
(namely your legs), and raises your heart rate and breathing, and which you can sustain for extended 
periods of time. The idea here is to pick an activity that has the potential to burn a lot of calories. You 
have plenty of choices. 
Running or Jogging Outdoors 
On the pro side, running is an outstanding cardio workout, the fat-burning potential is very high, it‘s 
free, and it doesn‘t require equipment. On the con side, running outdoors may not be possible, 
depending on the weather and where you live. If you‘re a beginner, running may be too intense, and if 
you‘re overweight, have orthopedic problems, or are injured it may not be feasible. High-volume 
endurance training, especially running, can also interfere with muscle size and strength gains. If you 
enjoy running, ignore naysayers and go for it, but keep the risks and benefits in mind. 
Walking 
Walking is ideal if you‘re overweight, a beginner, or you don‘t have the disposition for intense types 
of training. If you enjoy being outdoors and you have open space, parks, trails, or long stretches of 
beach near your home, walking or hiking can be a real joy and your cardio won‘t feel like work at all. 
There are few downsides except that the intensity is low, so you don‘t burn many calories per minute. 
Push the pace if you want to burn more. Walk at least 40 to 60 minutes a day for best results. Do it all 
at once or split it into shorter sessions. A pedometer is a great gadget for tracking your steps. The 
Fitbit is a popular one with Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle readers. 
Treadmills 
Many people prefer the outdoors, but treadmills do have advantages. They‘re nice when the weather is 
bad, and you can‘t beat the convenience of having cardio equipment at home. Good treadmill decks 
are designed to flex, which reduces impact forces. Treadmills also give you continuous feedback on 
their electronic consoles, including time, speed, distance, and heart rate. The calorie readouts on 
cardio machines are not always accurate, but if they let you input your body weight, it‘s a decent 

================================================================================
estimate. Most treadmills elevate to at least 10 percent to 12 percent. Walking uphill can increase the 
fat-burning potential and is a type of cardio almost anyone can do. Wearing a weighted vest can bump 
the calorie burn even more. 
Stationary Upright Bicycle 
Stationary cycling has moderate to high fat-burning potential, it‘s superb for cardiovascular 
conditioning, and it‘s a killer leg workout. Cycling is also preferred by many bodybuilders because it 
doesn‘t compromise leg muscle size the way distance running does. Cycling is nonimpact, so injury 
potential is low, but you must pedal vigorously or turn up the resistance to maximize the calorie burn. 
A client once complained he wasn‘t losing much weight even though he was riding the bike an hour 
several times a week. I chuckled as I told him, ―Turn on the power—you‘re pedaling at level zero.‖ If 
you get bored easily, then crank up the tunes on your iPod or park your bike in front of a TV. 
Stationary Recumbent Bicycle 
Recumbent bikes give you all the benefits of upright bikes, plus one more: The seats are 
ergonomically designed to be more comfortable, to support your lower back, and to reduce fatigue. 
This makes recumbent cycling a good option if you have lower back problems (or a bony butt!). Don‘t 
get too comfortable: Turn up the resistance and crank up the rpm‘s if you want to maximize your 
calorie burn. 
Outdoor Cycling 
Outdoor cycling can be a great fat burner, especially if you ride hills or push the pace and coast less. 
One long weekend ride can really boost your weekly calorie burn. Many people who prefer the 
outdoors find mountain biking or cross-country cycling not only excellent cardio but a great hobby or 
sport. If you dedicate yourself to a physically challenging sport you love—recreational or 
competitive—that can go a long way toward ending the struggle with body fat. 
Stair-climbers 
Stair-climbing machines give you an intense cardio workout and they‘re excellent calorie burners, 
making them ideal for fat loss. Avoid leaning on the handlebars or side rails because it lowers your 
heart rate and reduces the calorie burn. Stair-climbing machines provide a nonimpact workout, 
although the repetitive motion can aggravate knee pain in people with pre-existing problems. The 
StairMaster StepMill is a favorite of mine: it looks like a mini-escalator with a rotating flight of steps 
to simulate real stair stepping. Killer! 
Elliptical Machine 
Elliptical machines are similar to stair-climbers except they use a circular stride instead of an up-and-
down stride. This circular, no-impact motion may be helpful for people working around certain knee 
injuries. Ellipticals have increasing levels of resistance and ramps that let you change the angle, 
similar to a treadmill‘s incline. Some machines let you stride forward or backward or pump your arms. 

================================================================================
The fat-burning potential is moderate and may be high, but it‘s self-paced, so you must make a 
constant effort to maintain your speed. 
Rowing 
Rowing machines give you a superb cardio workout with very high fat-burning potential. Rowing is a 
complete exercise, working all the lower-body muscles as well as the upper-body pulling muscles. 
Rowing is a non-jarring, impact-free activity, so it‘s a good option for people seeking relief from 
lower-body joint pain. Always use perfect form, and if you‘ve ever had low back pain, use rowers 
with caution. 
Cross-country Skiing 
Cross-country skiing has a very high calorie- and fat-burning potential because, like rowing, it also 
involves the upper and lower body. Being a no-impact activity is another advantage. Cross-country 
skiing machines are not found in many gyms, but they have a cult following. The machine does 
involve a certain degree of skill and coordination, but if you stick with it through the learning curve 
until the awkwardness is gone, you‘ll be well rewarded. 
Swimming 
Swimming is a full-body exercise that puts your heart and lungs to the test. A great appeal for many 
people is the zero-impact nature of swimming: It‘s as friendly to your joints as cardio can get. The 
calorie burn can be very high, but to translate into significant fat loss, you have to be able to swim 
long enough for the calorie burn to add up. 
An interesting debate raged for years because research and observation kept suggesting that 
swimming wasn‘t very good for reducing body fat. It was later discovered that exercising in water, 
especially cold water, can increase your appetite. This resolved the swimmer‘s body fat paradox and 
was another great example of how exercising more does not guarantee weight loss if you‘re not 
careful about your food intake. 
Classes and Boot Camps 
Group exercise and aerobic dance classes have been around for ages, but in the last decade, boot 
camps, kickboxing, and cross-training have taken off in popularity. Typically, body weight exercises 
and conditioning drills are done nonstop or in circuits, which is what makes the workouts 
cardiovascular in nature. Depending on the programming, the calorie burn can be extremely high. 
People who don‘t want to use cardio machines often find a happy home in these classes. But keep in 
mind that they usually can‘t replace traditional progressive resistance weight training. Cardio training 
and resistance training each stand alone as important elements of this program. 
PICK THE CARDIO YOU ENJOY AND MIX IT UP IF YOU CHOOSE 
You‘re not limited to this list or only one type of cardio; there are advantages to mixing it up. 
Constantly changing cardio programs can make it difficult to calibrate and track the source of your 

================================================================================
results, but on the other hand, a change in cardio has been known to help break plateaus. Variety saves 
many people from boredom too. That goes for within the workout as well: There‘s no reason you can‘t 
pick three machines (or activities) and do 15 minutes of each instead of 45 minutes of one. If you do a 
lot of cardio, it‘s wise to alternate days of high-impact activities with days of low-impact activities, or 
alternate high-intensity cardio with low-intensity cardio. This simple trick saves a lot of people from 
chronic joint pain and burnout. 
Workout styles come and go, but you don‘t have to do things by the book or follow the crowd. 
Sometimes it‘s the trendiest workouts that have the highest dropout rates. I believe that if you keep 
your options open and pursue the training you enjoy the most, you‘ll get the best results in the long 
run. 
FREQUENCY OF CARDIO TRAINING: HOW OFTEN? 
How often you should train depends on your goals, your schedule and your desired rate of progress. 
Three days per week is a good starting point for almost everyone, because it‘s enough to enjoy health 
benefits, improve your conditioning, and increase fat loss. I like to call three cardio workouts a week a 
baseline. You may do more at times, but when you‘re committed to the fitness lifestyle, you usually 
won‘t do less. 
If you‘re not highly active already, it‘s easy to increase your fat loss simply by increasing your 
training frequency. Suppose you burn 400 calories per workout, three times a week. That‘s a total of 
1,200 calories a week. If you increased that to six days per week at 400 calories per workout, you 
would burn 2,400 calories per week. If all else remained equal, you‘ve doubled your fat loss! That was 
a no-brainer, wasn‘t it? 
What would happen if, in addition to increasing your cardio from three to six days per week, you 
increased the intensity so you were burning 600 calories per workout? With six workouts at 600 
calories per workout, you‘d be up to 3,600 calories per week. You just tripled your fat loss! 
Could speeding up fat loss really be that simple? Well, your body is deviously complex in the ways 
it can adapt or trigger compensation, and there‘s a point where doing more brings diminishing returns 
or gets impractical. But if all else remains equal, then yes: The more often you do cardio, the more 
calories you‘ll burn and the more fat you‘ll lose. You don‘t even need to know how many calories 
every workout burns; just realize that there‘s a direct dose-response relationship. When you multiply 
frequency with duration and intensity, you can accelerate your fat loss exponentially. 
Let me put it this way: If I were overweight and I knew what I know now about fat loss, I would be 
doing cardio every day, possibly even twice a day, seven days a week, until I was happy with my 
weight. Only then would I taper down to a maintenance program. 
That said, it‘s usually better to build up gradually. Many beginners try to do too much too soon, 
then they find themselves burned out or injured, especially if the cardio was intense or high-impact. 
Start with at least three sessions per week, and if your goal is maximum fat loss, progressively build 
up to five, six, or seven days per week as your weekly results dictate.

For maximum fat loss 

================================================================================
3–4 days per week 
5–7 days per week 
DURATION OF CARDIO TRAINING: HOW LONG? 
If your cardio is high in intensity, the sessions will be shorter and you‘ll still burn a lot of calories. If 
your cardio is low-intensity, you need to exercise longer for the calorie burn to accumulate. If your 
goal is fat loss, 30 to 45 minutes at a moderate intensity is usually more than enough time to achieve 
the type of calorie burn you need. In some cases, like interval training, where the intensity is very 
high, as little as 15 to 20 minutes can do it. 
You could build up to 60 minutes a day, but you might consider splitting it up. For example, 30 
minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening is more doable for many people, and multiple 
sessions might stimulate your metabolism more. Keep in mind the possibility of diminishing returns. 
At some point it‘s better to tighten up your nutrition and train more efficiently. If you‘re doing an hour 
or more of cardio every day but you‘re not losing fat, you almost always have a nutrition problem. 
Double-check your food intake first, because throwing more cardio at this kind of ―plateau‖ is like 
bailing water faster when there‘s a gaping hole in your boat. Fix the hole first, then bail! 
Busy people need the most efficient workouts possible, and no one wants to waste time, so short, 
high-intensity workouts are popular for good reasons. Unfortunately, another reason that minimalist 
workouts are popular is because they sell better. The body of your dreams in ―just minutes a day, a 
few days a week‖ is a powerful sales pitch. 
There‘s a big difference between efficient training and fitness marketing hype. If you can‘t tell them 
apart, you‘re in trouble. I‘m not sure whether to laugh, cry, or scream when I see other trainers 
advertising their ―super-intense‖ four- or eight–minute workouts as ideal for fat loss. Claims like these 
are ridiculous. No matter how hard you train, you can burn only so many calories per minute. 
Granted, don‘t fall into the trap of mindlessly punching the cardio time clock either. Logging a 
certain number of minutes doesn‘t necessarily guarantee the fat loss you want. If the intensity is too 
low, your progress will be slow. 
Your mission is to find that ―sweet spot‖ in the middle where intensity times duration yields the 
highest calorie burn. I believe that sweet spot—which provides both efficiency and effectiveness—is 
around 20 to 30 minutes of high-intensity cardio or 40 to 45 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio. 
If you‘re a beginner, it‘s okay to increase the duration gradually. Many of our members said that 
walking to their mailbox was a ―workout‖ when they were obese. They didn‘t get discouraged. They 
did what they could and added a little bit more each time. Today, some of these members run 
marathons or ride in 100-mile bike races.

INTENSITY OF CARDIO TRAINING: HOW HARD? 
You can always burn more calories by working harder in the time you have, but there is a catch. If you 
sprint, you burn an enormous amount of calories per minute, but you won‘t last long. If you pace 
yourself leisurely, you could keep going for hours, but you won‘t burn many calories per minute. If 
you want maximum fat loss, the trick is to work hard enough so you hit that sweet spot for maximum 
calorie burn. 
One way to find your ideal training intensity is by heart rate. The ―age-predicted‖ method has been 
recommended in fitness books for decades. You estimate your maximum heart rate (MHR) with this 
formula: 220 minus your age. Then multiply your MHR by a target intensity range of 70 percent to 85 
percent. Choose 70 percent to 75 percent for moderate; 75 percent to 80 percent for moderately hard; 
or 80 percent to 85 percent for hard. 
Here‘s an example: If you‘re 30 years old, your estimated MHR is 190. For a moderately intense 
workout, multiply the 70 percent to 75 percent intensity range by 190 and you get a target heart rate 
zone of 133 to 142 beats per minute (bpm). 
During each cardio session, periodically check your pulse at your wrist or neck. The easy way is 
with 10-second counts: Simply divide your 60-second target heart rate by 6. If your target zone is 133 
to 143 bpm, your 10-second count is 22 to 24. If you‘re below your target zone, raise the intensity by 
increasing resistance, speed, or incline. Many people invest in a heart rate monitor. A chest strap 
transmits your heart rate to a wristwatch or cardio machine, letting you check your heart rate easily 
without interrupting your training rhythm. 
The classic 220-minus-age formula can underestimate MHR in older adults and overestimate it in 
young people by as much as +/‒10 bpm. A new equation (the Seals formula) was published in the 
Journal of the American College of Cardiology: 208 − 0.7 × age. This decreases the margin for error 
at the age extremes. If you really wanted to know your actual MHR, you‘d need to do a maximal 
exercise test, in which an exercise physiologist hooks you up to a bunch of monitors and runs you 
faster and steeper until you cry uncle. 
All heart rate formulas are only estimates, so use common sense about how your exertion level 
feels. If it feels ridiculously easy, then don‘t be afraid to increase the intensity. If it feels incredibly 
difficult, don‘t hesitate to decrease the intensity.

HOW TO ESTIMATE TRAINING INTENSITY WITH PERCEIVED 
EXERTION 

================================================================================
The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is a simple shortcut method for estimating the intensity of your 
workout. You simply rate how hard your workout feels on a scale from 1 to 10. Even though it 
appears simplistic and is completely subjective, perceived exertion is surprisingly reliable. Basically, 
if you think your workout is ―very hard,‖ like an 8 out of 10, it probably is. 
Based on the 1 to 10 RPE scale, a 4 to 8 would be the ideal target zone for steady state cardio and 
also for hitting that fat-burning sweet spot—not too easy, not too hard.

Breathing and Sweating as Measures of Exercise Intensity 
Breathing rate is another way to estimate training intensity. If you‘re not breathing heavily, you‘re not 
working hard. If you‘re so out of breath that you can‘t finish a sentence or hold a conversation (the 
―talk test‖), your intensity is probably too high for steady-state training. 

================================================================================
Sweating, on the other hand, is not a good gauge for training intensity or calories burned. Sweat is 
simply your body‘s cooling mechanism, which gets turned on when your body temperature rises. 
Heavy sweating will lead to weight loss but not fat loss. Water weight comes right back as soon as you 
rehydrate. 
HIGH-INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING (HIIT) FOR TIME-
EFFICIENT FITNESS AND FAT LOSS 
If you want to burn the most calories possible during a workout, the way to do it would be through 
high intensity and long duration. The problem is that intensity and duration are inversely related; or, as 
they say, you can‘t sprint through a marathon. You can‘t even sprint for 10 minutes. An all-out sprint 
will last only seconds, and a near-maximum sprint may last only a minute or two. There is a way, 
however, to combine higher intensity with longer duration and it‘s called high-intensity interval 
training (HIIT). 
HIIT allows you to accumulate a larger volume of high-intensity work in a single session by 
alternating between short high-intensity work intervals and short lower-intensity recovery intervals. 
During the high-intensity interval, you push yourself above your normal training zone to the point 
where you start getting out of breath. During the recovery interval, you reduce the intensity enough so 
you reclaim the oxygen debt just in time to do another intense burst. 
You can adjust the number of intervals, length of intervals, and the work-to-recovery ratio based on 
your goals and fitness level. Beginners might start with 6 rounds and work up to 8 to 12 rounds. The 
interval length can vary from 10- to 20-second all-out sprints to submaximal but intense 60- to 90-
second bursts. You could make work intervals longer, but you‘d be sacrificing intensity. Longer 
recovery intervals make it easier; shorter recovery intervals make it harder. For example, 60 seconds 
of work followed by 120 seconds of recovery (a 1:2 ratio) is easier; 60 seconds of work followed by 
60 seconds of recovery (a 1:1 ratio) is harder. 
For fat-loss goals, the duration needs to be long enough so the calorie burn adds up, but with 
interval training, you can get an effective fat-loss workout in as little as 20 minutes. That makes HIIT 
one of the most time-efficient types of cardio and a favorite for busy people. For cardiovascular 
conditioning, some types of HIIT are amazingly effective, even when the workouts are shorter. 
You can do HIIT training on any type of cardio machine. You can also do HIIT running outdoors or 
with various body weight exercises or conditioning drills. There‘s no single best way, so be open-
minded, experiment, and see what works best for you. 
Classic Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle Fat-Loss HIIT Workout 
The classic HIIT workout for fat loss is 8 to 12 rounds with 60-second high-intensity intervals and a 
1:1 work-to-recovery ratio. 
Warm up for 3 to 5 minutes steady state at a low RPE. 
High-intensity interval: Perform one minute of very hard work at 8 to 9 RPE. 
Recovery interval: Perform one minute of light to moderate work at 3 to 4 RPE. 
Repeat for 10 intervals (rounds). 
Cool down for 3 to 5 minutes at a low RPE. 
Total workout time: 26 to 30 minutes 

================================================================================
Hill Running, Stadium Stepping, and Sprint Intervals 
When you‘re ready for a real challenge, try running stairs. This is a form of sprint interval training in 
which you work all out, or close to it, for about 10 to 20 seconds, then recover. The work-to-rest ratio 
is usually 2:1 or 3:1. Here‘s how I do it: 
I have access to a university stadium with a straight flight of 52 steps. Sprinting up takes about 10 
seconds; walking down about 30 seconds. I warm up first, usually starting with walking, a slow jog, 
and then a run up before sprinting, usually 10 to 12 rounds. Some athletes do a lot more, but your 
intensity drops as your legs get fatigued, so go for quality, not just quantity. 
If you want to top off the calorie burn to stimulate more fat loss, you could finish with a walk or jog 
around the track. Running stairs is also an amazing leg workout. Bodybuilders and figure athletes love 
it because they say it brings out the muscularity in their legs. Jogging up flights of stairs in a high-rise 
is another option if you don‘t have access to stadium steps. 
No stairs? Hills get the job done, too, and may give you even more flexibility in the duration of 
your intervals because hills come in all sizes. Grassy hills are nice when available, as they spare you 
some of the impact from running on pavement. Running hills has a built-in safety factor too. Strength 
coach Steven Morris says, ―Even an athlete with horrendous running form will be safe running hills. 
This is simply because the hill does NOT allow the athlete to over-stride nor does it allow them to 
reach top speed, both major factors in hamstring injuries.‖ 
No stairs or hills? Sprinting intervals on a level track, field, or beach are popular too. On these, be 
sure to warm up fully and play it safe, as pulled hamstrings are no fun. Because all types of sprint 
interval training are so intense, once to three times a week is all it takes. If you‘re also weight training, 
any more is overkill. 
Running stairs, hills, or flat sprints are advanced workouts. Beginners need to slowly build up to it. 
If you‘re overweight, it may be a challenge just to walk up stairs, let alone run, not to mention that it 
might be too stressful on your joints. But as you get lighter and fitter, it‘s a challenge you might work 
toward. I know a man named Jon from Chicago who was at one time morbidly obese—340 pounds, 
with a 60-inch waist. He lost 150 pounds and then started running the Willis Tower (formerly the 
Sears Tower) and other skyscraper races. If he can do it, you can. 
HOW HIGH-INTENSITY TRAINING ACTIVATES THE 
―AFTERBURN EFFECT‖ 
Here‘s another benefit of doing some of your cardio workouts with high intensity: It can boost your 
metabolism for hours after the workout is over. This is commonly known as the afterburn effect. The 
scientific term is excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). This means you could literally 
burn extra fat all day long as you sit at your desk. 
Low-intensity training doesn‘t stimulate much EPOC. The higher the intensity and the longer an 
intense workout is sustained, the higher the EPOC. According to Jack H. Wilmore and David L. 
Costill in Physiology of Sport and Exercise, the EPOC after moderate training (75 percent to 80 
percent of MHR) is approximately 0.25 kilocalories per minute. If the afterburn lasted for five hours, 
that would be an extra 75 calories burned after the workout is over. That‘s not earth-shattering, but if 
all else remained equal, that would burn an extra pound of fat every 10 weeks. 
When training intensity is high, that‘s when it gets really interesting. In a recent study from 
Appalachian State University, researchers had subjects cycle for 45 minutes nonstop. The intensity 
was about as high as it could go for steady state training: around 85 percent of MHR. They measured 

================================================================================
an increase in metabolism that lasted 14 hours after the workout ended, including while the subjects 
were sleeping. The EPOC accounted for an extra 190 calories burned. 
IS THERE A BEST TIME OF DAY TO DO CARDIO? 
The best time of day for cardio or any other type of training is the time you feel most physically 
energetic, most mentally focused, most motivated, and most likely to make it a habit and stick with it. 
The way I see it, all other considerations are secondary, even if there are physiological advantages 
from training at specific times. Your daily training schedule is one of those personal things where it‘s 
best to listen to your body and keep practical considerations in mind. 
Many people have had great success training in the morning. Some of the benefits may be 
behavioral or psychological. Taking positive action in the morning starts your day on the right foot 
and makes you feel good all day long. This may help you stick with your plan the rest of the day 
because you‘ll want to stay consistent and keep your momentum going. 
It‘s easy to blow off evening workouts when you‘re exhausted from work. When you train at the 
beginning of your day, your workout is out of the way. And remember, no matter how busy you are, 
you can always make time for training by getting up earlier in the morning. 
CARDIO FED OR FASTED? 
Many bodybuilders believe that cardio on an empty stomach helps them get leaner. Their preferred 
time is first thing in the morning after the overnight fast. This practice has been controversial for as 
long as it‘s been popular. Downsides for fasted cardio include concerns about muscle loss and low 
training energy. The upside, say proponents, is that it should allow fat to be more easily released from 
fat cells into circulation and then burned for energy. Whether doing cardio fasted improves body 
composition from week to week is the question still being debated. We would need more long-term 
research on people with different body fat levels to know for sure. Bodybuilders have low body fat to 
begin with. When you‘re already lean and you want to get even leaner, every little nutrition and 
training detail counts, so that might explain their preference for and apparent success with fasted 
cardio. 
If you‘re debating whether to eat before a morning workout, there are a few factors to consider. One 
is intensity. Most people have more energy, feel better mentally, and perform better physically when 
they have some fuel in them. If you‘re lifting weights or doing intense cardio in the morning, it‘s 
probably ideal to have one of your meals beforehand, including protein. If you must train immediately 
at the crack of dawn and don‘t want a full meal sloshing around in your stomach, you could at least 
have a light meal, a snack, or a protein drink and then eat your first full meal after training. 
If your morning workout is only cardio, most people have no problem doing it fasted before 
breakfast (a cup of coffee helps!) as long as the intensity is not too high. Low or moderate intensity 
cardio isn‘t that stressful and doesn‘t require that much energy, so the risk of muscle loss is low. Who 
knows, you might see better fat loss too. In the bigger scheme of things, it probably doesn‘t matter 
much whether you do your cardio fed or fasted. If you do it consistently and maintain your calorie 
deficit you‘ll get leaner either way. 
CARDIO BEFORE WEIGHTS, AFTER WEIGHTS, OR IN A 
COMPLETELY SEPARATE SESSION? 

================================================================================
When you schedule your training is completely up to you. Timing is secondary to training consistently 
and achieving your calorie deficit consistently. In a perfect scenario, there are advantages of doing 
cardio and weight training in separate sessions or at least doing cardio after weights in the same 
session. 
Research at the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that weight-lifting performance 
suffered right after doing intense cardio and up to eight hours afterward, especially for the legs. It‘s 
tough to do cardio after an intense leg workout and even tougher to do a leg workout after intense 
cardio. If you separate cardio and weights, fatigue won‘t get in the way as much. The fresher you are 
at the start of each workout, the stronger you‘ll be and the harder you can train. 
Sometimes, however, what‘s optimal on paper is trumped by personal preference and practical 
considerations. Many people feel fine doing cardio right after weights, not to mention that schlepping 
to the gym twice is inconvenient. So if you do cardio and weights in the same session, which should 
come first? The answer is: whichever is the higher priority. On Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, 
maintaining muscle is the top training priority, so weight training goes first and cardio second. 
DOES CARDIO MAKE YOU LOSE MUSCLE OR STRENGTH? 
There‘s been a lot of research about the interference effects between strength training and endurance 
training. It‘s clear that your body can‘t achieve maximum results in both endeavors concurrently 
because many strength and endurance adaptations in muscle fibers, organelles, hormones, enzymes, 
and capillaries are antagonistic to one another. It‘s unlikely that you‘ll see an active marathoner win a 
bodybuilding contest. To excel at a sport, the training demands must be specific to that sport‘s goals. 
This is why so many strength athletes are conservative about cardio and some even shun it. But does 
cardio always interfere with weight training? Will cardio make you lose muscle? What about people 
whose primary goal is fat loss? 
Research plus real-world results from competitive bodybuilders suggest there‘s plenty of room for 
both. Weights are the first priority, but most bodybuilders integrate cardio in small amounts year 
round and in larger amounts before contests. The cardio is instrumental in helping them achieve peak 
condition, and they have no problem maintaining their muscle mass as they get ripped. 
In moderation, cardio might even enhance muscle development. Cardio helps increase nutrient 
clearance from the blood and uptake into the cells. It can increase capillary density, which enhances 
delivery of oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the muscles. It also helps remove waste products from 
working muscle tissue. As your cardiovascular fitness improves, you can recover faster from weight 
training. And of course, if you‘ve sucked wind after a set of squats, you can appreciate the role of 
good cardio in a strength training workout. 
With moderate amounts of cardio, muscle loss shouldn‘t be a concern. If your cardio volume is so 
high it looks more like an endurance athlete‘s regime, you may be compromising some strength and it 
will pay to monitor your lean body mass closely. High-volume endurance training while on a very 
low-calorie diet can be catabolic, and has been known to cause metabolic adaptations even more 
severe than starvation dieting alone. 
CARDIO PERIODIZATION: THE FAT-LOSS SECRET OF THE 
LEANEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 
Despite the promise of leaning out faster, there seems to be, if not a loathing of cardio due to the time, 
effort, or boredom involved, then certainly an irrational fear that too much cardio will do bad things to 

================================================================================
you. The fact is the human body is a remarkable machine, and at least for short periods can perform a 
lot more work than most people give it credit for. Almost all of the negatives you hear about cardio are 
related to long periods of high-volume training, without proper recovery periods in between, or from 
doing large amounts of cardio in an aggressive calorie deficit. 
Getting all the positives that cardio has to offer, without the negatives, is mostly a matter of doing 
more cardio when you need it and less when you don‘t. In weight-lifting and other strength sports, 
periodization is a strategy used by all the top athletes. Instead of constantly pounding their bodies with 
long, hard, heavy workouts, they vary their intensity, volume, weight, and other training variables in 
weekly, monthly, and yearly cycles. This allows them to achieve peak performance without burnout or 
injury. Why more people don‘t apply this concept to cardio training is a mystery to me. Doing hard 
cardio for hours every day or seven days a week, month after month, year after year, is unnecessary 
and may lead to overuse injury, suppressed immunity, overtraining, mental burnout, or aerobic 
adaptation. 
To a certain degree, adaptation is a normal part of getting in shape. The more you train, the more 
efficient you get at doing the workouts until you eventually need a more challenging workout to keep 
improving. But the smart way to make improvements and reach new peaks is through cycles and 
seasons of varying workloads, not putting your body through ever-increasing and never-ending stress. 
Competitive bodybuilders are the true masters of peaking their physiques for a deadline and getting 
better and better, year after year, throughout their careers. Cardio periodization is one of their secrets. 
There‘s a maintenance phase (athletes sometimes call it an off season) and a peaking phase (the 
precontest season). During the maintenance phase, you do less cardio and during the fat-loss or 
peaking phase you do more. Your body fat level will go up a bit when you cycle back to the off-
season phase, but with each successive phase you shoot for a new all-time best condition. 
This isn‘t just for bodybuilders; it‘s a smart strategy for everyone. Once you‘ve achieved your target 
weight and body fat level, don‘t stop doing cardio, but don‘t keep blasting away for hours either. 
Slowly downshift into a maintenance phase. Once or twice a year, if you want a challenge, ramp up 
the cardio again and go for a personal best. 
BURN MORE! BUT MORE IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER 
When being introduced to Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle and the burn-more philosophy for the first 
time, it‘s not uncommon for readers to misinterpret my enthusiasm for training as implying that more 
is always better. Considering the magnitude of the obesity problem and how profoundly sedentary 
most people are, more probably is better! But this is only true as far as it remains safe, practical, 
effective, and in alignment with your goals. 
For strength and power athletes, the best amount of cardio might be the least you can get away with. 
Physique athletes know they need more cardio before contests, but not so much in the off season. 
Endomorphs usually understand that they do better with more cardio all around. 
What I‘m really recommending is being willing to do what it takes to get the results you want at the 
speed you want them—and, most importantly, to customize your own plan. 
QUICK START 
Not sure how much cardio you should do for maximum benefit and minimum risk? Here’s a 
simple shortcut formula, backed by research and experience: A foolproof starting point is three 
to four days per week of the cardio of your choice, for 20–40 minutes at a moderate to high 
intensity. If you’re already fit and your time is limited, do up to three sessions of high-intensity 

================================================================================
interval training (HIIT) per week. When you need to accelerate fat loss, simply increase the 
duration and frequency a little bit each week until you get the rate of fat loss you want. 
YOUR PERSONAL CARDIO PLAN 
The ultimate cardio program is the one you design for yourself. This chapter has given you everything 
you need to create your own program, so that‘s exactly how we‘re going to wrap it up. All you have to 
do is choose the following cardio training variables and write them down in the 28-day-plan calendar: 
1.  Frequency (how many days per week) 
2.  Type of cardio (you can mix it up or stick with the same type every session) 
3.  Duration (how many minutes) 
4.  Intensity level (% of MHR or RPE) 
5.  Mode/resistance/speed (steady state or intervals; grade, resistance level, or speed) 
Let me give you three examples for one week and then you can map out your plan for all four 
weeks:

Remember to do a progress check at the end of every week, including weight, body composition, 
and a visual assessment. Cardio programs are meant to be changeable and progressive. If you‘re not 
making the progress you want, then you‘ll increase the intensity, duration, or frequency. 
Ultimately, you can always depend on the feedback loop method; let your results dictate your 
approach. If your fat loss is too slow, crank up the cardio. If you‘re hitting your weekly goals with 
only a few sessions a week, no increase is needed. In fact, unless you have a deadline looming, it‘s 
best to do the minimum necessary and save the extra cardio for the peaking cycle or for breaking 
plateaus later down the road. It‘s always good to have an ace in the hole, and cardio should be one of 
yours. 
NEW BODY 
WEIGHT TRAINING (The 4
th Element) 
What could be better than getting leaner, healthier, and fitter? How about getting leaner, healthier, fitter, and stronger—and 
completely changing your shape into the body you‘ve always dreamed of? Now we‘re talking! You can have all of that—if you‘ll 
commit to making this fourth and final element a part of your plan—and your lifestyle. 
This is the part almost everyone misses when pursuing a weight-loss goal. And missing this element is why most weight-loss 
programs fail. Including this fourth element—weight training—is what makes the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle unique among 
fat-loss programs, and why it succeeds so brilliantly. In the two weight training chapters ahead, you‘ll learn all the reasons why 
weight training is so important, not only for fat loss, but to strengthen and shape your body. 
If you‘re a beginner who feels intimidated or scared by the weights, you can relax knowing that I‘ve designed an entry-level 
―primer‖ program just for you. 
If you‘re experienced, don‘t worry about this program being too easy. Even if you‘re a master‘s level lifter, I‘ve designed a 
plan for your needs—it‘s called The New Body 28 (TNB-28). You can scale the difficulty level to where even athletes and 
bodybuilders will feel challenged. 
When you think about how much effort you‘re going to put into this training program, how diligently you‘ll follow the plan, 
and whether you‘ll merely do it for a month or two, or like the most successful physique athletes, you make it a part of your 
lifestyle, remember this most of all: You can lose weight with a diet, but only weight training can increase your strength and 
literally give you a new body. 
 

================================================================================
CHAPTER 16 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle 
Weight Training: The Principles 
There is nothing as good as bodybuilding to get your body tuned up and totally in shape. 
—Arnold Schwarzenegger 
LIFT WEIGHTS, DROP FAT 
It would be far beyond the scope of one chapter to teach you everything there is to know about weight 
training. A great example is Arnold Schwarzenegger‘s Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding. It‘s 736 
pages long, with 850 photographs! As an exercise science major in college, I spent an entire semester 
on weight training, and even that didn‘t scratch the surface. Weight training is an art, a science, and a 
discipline that you can study and practice your whole life and it would take another book to do justice 
to the details. 
However, no fat-loss program is complete without resistance training because it plays such a crucial 
role in getting leaner. This surprises many people who only think of diet and aerobics when they think 
of fat loss. A bodybuilder or strength athlete doesn‘t need convincing to make weight training priority 
number one. But most people with weight-loss goals think this doesn‘t apply to them. It‘s time to 
change that. 
In this chapter, you‘ll learn the most important weight training fundamentals they teach you in 
school, as well as secrets from the trenches, known only by the best physique champions. You‘ll hear 
the truth about common muscle myths that might be holding you back and discover not only how to 
burn more fat but how to transform your body shape completely. You‘ll then be ready for my step-by-
step 28-day training plan, The New Body 28 (TNB-28 for short), in the next chapter, which will get 
you started the right way and keep the results coming. 
SYNERGY: THE SECRET TO EXPONENTIALLY FASTER FAT LOSS 
―It‘s 80% diet!‖ is a common weight-loss cliché. Even if this isn‘t literally accurate, it‘s fair to say that 
nutrition is the most important element for fat loss. That‘s because even if you have a perfect training 
program, you won‘t lose weight without a calorie deficit. The success of any weight-loss goal hinges 
on getting this one nutrition detail right. But if you‘re smart and your goals go beyond weight loss to 
better body composition and permanent fat loss, then weight training is an equally vital part of the 
formula. 
The secret to achieving your best body is in how well you implement all four elements of the 
program at the same time. The combination of nutrition, cardio training, resistance training, and 
mental training together becomes greater than the sum of its parts. This is known as synergy, and it 
means that 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 might not equal 4, it might equal 40 or 400! When balanced properly, each 
element complements and enhances the others. The best example is the powerful phenomenon called 
partitioning, which is what happens when you put proper nutrition and weight training together. 

================================================================================
The law of energy balance says that if you‘re in a surplus, excess calories will be sent into fat 
stores. That‘s more or less true for a couch potato. The law of energy partitioning says that if you‘re in 
a surplus, but you‘re weight training, some of those excess calories will be sent to your muscles for 
repair and growth. Imagine two people following the same meal plan with a calorie surplus. One lifts 
weights and the other doesn‘t. The one not lifting weights gets fatter. The one lifting weights not only 
doesn‘t get fatter, he gets more muscular by eating more! 
This partitioning of calories and nutrients is even more interesting in the other direction. Two 
people go on the same meal plan in a calorie deficit. One person is lifting weights and the other isn‘t. 
Since the laws of thermodynamics can‘t be violated, you know they‘re both going to lose weight. The 
real question is: What kind of weight will they lose? The person not lifting weights loses lean body 
mass. The person lifting weights loses fat and keeps his lean body mass; he might even gain a little. 
Two people. Same diet. Totally different results. This is more proof that weight loss and body 
transformation are not the same and that transformation goes far beyond calories in versus calories 
out. It‘s what your body does with the calories that counts. 
Weight loss is a matter of energy balance. Body composition is a matter of energy partitioning. 
Your food choices, genetics, lifestyle, and hormones can all affect partitioning. But the biggest 
influence is weight training. Wouldn‘t you love to see the food you eat get delivered to your muscle 
cells for growth and recovery instead of being stuffed into your fat cells? Combine good nutrition with 
weight training and that‘s exactly what happens. 
HOW WEIGHT TRAINING HELPS YOU GET LEANER 
One reason that weight training increases fat loss is obvious but is almost always overlooked: It burns 
a lot of calories. It‘s entirely possible for your weight training to burn more calories than your cardio, 
especially if you do a lot of energy-demanding exercises like squats, lunges, rows, presses, dead lifts, 
and other compound lifts. 
An even bigger surprise is the metabolic boost. This afterburn effect is becoming mainstream 
knowledge, often written about in fitness magazines, but most people think it only comes from 
interval training. The truth is weight training can produce an equal if not greater metabolic boost than 
cardio. There‘s also a high-energy cost required for repairing muscle damage from training and for 
building new muscle. And these are only the short-term effects. There‘s also the long-term boost in 
metabolism you get from increasing your lean body mass. The higher your lean body mass, the higher 
your metabolic rate. 
WHY WEIGHTS SHOULD BE PRIORITY NUMBER ONE IN EVERY 
FAT-LOSS TRAINING PROGRAM 
For years, weight training was like Rodney Dangerfield: It got no respect. Weight lifters were viewed 
as weirdos or freaks. Athletes were encouraged not to lift weights. Just one generation ago, people 
thought that weight training made you slow and muscle-bound and raised your blood pressure. At one 
time even the medical establishment said to avoid weight training in favor of aerobics. 
Today, all world-class athletes do serious weight training. Every pro sports team has a strength and 
conditioning coach. Doctors prescribe weight training for cardiovascular health, better bone density, 
and stopping sarcopenia as you get older. Psychologists recommend it for building self-confidence and 
even overcoming depression. In 1990 the American College of Sports Medicine released an updated 

================================================================================
position stand stating that weight training decreases cardiovascular risk factors and was good for your 
health all along. 
It was great news when the scientific, medical, and athletic communities started supporting weight 
training, except for one thing. In perfect character with the notoriously fickle fitness industry, many 
strength-training gurus started flipping to the other extreme, saying that weight training is the only 
kind of training you need and that cardio is worthless or actually bad for you. 
There‘s no question: You‘ll improve body composition far more with weights than you will with 
cardio alone. If you go overboard, cardio can interfere with strength, power, and muscle gains. 
However, in the right amounts, cardio and weights not only get along well together, they‘re great 
companions, producing the most rapid fat loss and dramatic physique transformations possible. 
QUICK START 
Progressive resistance training—namely weight lifting—is the single most powerful body 
transformation tool you can use. A weight training program combined with proper nutrition 
will burn fat and re-shape your body faster than any other single form of exercise. If you’re ever 
in doubt about how to start working out, start with resistance training. Add cardio and other 
types of training from there. 
THE TEN BIGGEST WEIGHT-TRAINING MYTHS THAT HOLD YOU 
BACK FROM ACHIEVING YOUR BEST BODY 
Weight training can seem intimidating at first because there‘s so much conflicting information about 
what it will and won‘t do for you. The misconceptions about training are endless, but these ten big 
ones are insidious because they prevent so many people from taking the first step. Let‘s bust these 
myths once and for all. 
MYTH #1: IF FAT LOSS IS YOUR GOAL AND YOU DON’T HAVE 
TIME FOR WEIGHTS AND CARDIO, YOU SHOULD JUST DO 
CARDIO. 
Resistance training is such a powerful health, fitness, and antiaging tool, it‘s the one type of training 
you never compromise. Weight training can burn fat, increase your strength, and maintain or build 
your lean body mass. Cardio alone can‘t do that. Weight training makes the difference between the 
person with an ideal weight but an average-looking body and the person who looks cut and chiseled 
like a fitness model. When you have time, do weights and cardio. When your time is limited, always 
prioritize the weights. With that said, please allow me to step on my soapbox for a minute to talk 
about time. 
―I don‘t have time‖ is not a valid reason, it‘s an excuse. It‘s not that some people have more time; 
some people are simply better at prioritizing. You‘re being honest if you say, ―Other things are higher 
priorities right now,‖ but you can‘t honestly say, ―I don‘t have time to work out.‖ Many get up at five 
in the morning because it‘s the only time they can train. The rest of their day is full with work and 
family commitments. Paradoxically, it‘s often the busiest people who get more done than anyone else, 
because their schedule forces them to become masters of productivity. If they can do it, you can do it. 

================================================================================
MYTH #2: YOU SHOULD LOSE ALL THE FAT FIRST, THEN START 
WEIGHT TRAINING LATER. 
People who are extremely overweight may need to focus on nutrition at first if they‘re not very mobile 
yet. But if you‘re physically able to exercise safely, you‘ll get amazing benefits from starting a 
weight-training program, even if you still have a lot of fat to lose. Almost anyone can start with 
walking for cardio and basic lifts for strength, and it‘s never too soon to start developing good habits. 
Yes, you can lose weight with diet and cardio or even diet alone, but many people who do that find 
they‘re not as happy with their bodies as they thought they‘d be. They fit into smaller clothes, but they 
still don‘t want to be seen out of clothes. They look soft and unathletic. It‘s never too late to pick up 
the weights, but wouldn‘t it be better to start training from day one and finish with a stronger, harder, 
and more athletic body? 
MYTH #3: YOU HAVE TO JOIN A GYM TO GET GOOD RESULTS. 
The best place to train is wherever you‘ll get the best workouts and do them consistently. I started 
working out in my parent‘s garage when I was 14 with nothing more than barbells, dumbbells, an 
adjustable Joe Weider bench, a squat rack, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger book to guide me. I did that 
for six months, then I joined a gym. I‘ve been training in gyms ever since because I like having access 
to all the equipment and I enjoy the motivating atmosphere. 
Gold‘s Gym, the original ―bodybuilder‘s gym,‖ where Arnold got his start, has been my favorite 
chain for decades (I even did a brief stint as a trainer for Gold‘s). It‘s my kind of place. Your kind of 
place may be different, but if you find the right one, your gym can become a second home and a great 
source of friends and partners who support your new goals. 
The benefits of home training are convenience, privacy, and saving money you would have spent on 
gym memberships every year. If training at home helps you stick to your program better, and you 
prefer the privacy, then train at home. Some of the exercises in the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle 
training programs require machines, but it‘s easy to substitute other exercises. 
Basic free weights are all you need to start at home. You can do hundreds of exercises with nothing 
more than dumbbells. Add a barbell set and a bench that‘s fully adjustable (from flat to inclined to 
vertical) and you can do hundreds more. If you have the space, the next equipment you want in your 
home gym would be a power (squat) rack with a pull-up bar, dipping bars, and a cable machine with a 
low and high pulley. You‘ll get more mileage from this simple setup than all the fancy machines they 
sell on late night infomercials. 
MYTH #4: IF YOU LIFT WEIGHTS, YOU’LL GET BULKY OR LOOK 
LIKE A BODYBUILDER. 
Most natural bodybuilders, myself included, would love to have more muscle size, but we‘re still 
working on it after years because gaining muscle is a slow and difficult process. Beginners can gain 
muscle easily at first, but the rate of progress levels off quickly. Only the most genetically gifted 
mesomorphs can gain muscle with ease. Putting on muscle size is even harder for women, who have 
less testosterone. 
Despite my reassurance that every ounce of muscle gained is a hard-fought victory, most women 
(and some men) are still worried about getting too big. I think a major source of this fear is from 
misconceptions about pro bodybuilders. It‘s easy to look at the bulk on those guys and say, ―If that‘s 

================================================================================
what lifting weights will make me look like, forget it!‖ What they don‘t realize is that they‘re looking 
at a mesomorph on steroids whose full-time job for the last ten years has been eating and training. 
Even if you do have Olympian genetics, you‘re not going to wake up one morning and notice that 
you‘ve sprouted new muscle overnight. The process occurs very slowly and it doesn‘t happen by 
accident. 
When you master the art of training, you‘re in total control of how your body looks. You‘re the 
artist and your body is your masterpiece. Cardio chisels away the excess you don‘t want. Lifting adds 
muscle like clay—right where you do want it. You can sculpt your body into the exact figure you 
want. You may not be a bodybuilder, but if you lift weights, you are a body sculptor. And remember, 
you can‘t sculpt anything with diet alone. 
MYTH #5: IF YOU STOP LIFTING WEIGHTS THE MUSCLES WILL 
TURN INTO FAT. 
If you stop lifting, your muscles will eventually shrink, and if you eat too much, your body fat will 
increase. This may appear as if your ―muscles have turned to fat,‖ but muscle can‘t change into fat 
because fat and muscle are two different types of tissue. 
This myth probably comes from the retired-athlete syndrome. Elite athletes practice, train, or 
compete for hours every day, burning huge amounts of fuel. When their athletic careers end, their 
activity levels drop, but if they keep eating the same amount of food, they instantly create a calorie 
surplus and start gaining fat. This makes it look like their muscles ―turned to fat‖ purely because they 
stopped working out. 
This program is all about helping you develop long-lasting habits and a long-term outlook. If you 
make training a part of your new lifestyle, you‘ll never have to worry about shrinking muscles and 
rising body fat. If your activity level ever drops suddenly due to an injury or lifestyle change, all you 
have to do is recalculate your calories based on your new activity level and adjust your food intake. 
MYTH #6: IF YOU LIFT WEIGHTS, YOU’LL LOSE FLEXIBILITY 
AND GET MUSCLE-BOUND. 
The surest way to decrease your flexibility is to sit on your butt all day long doing nothing. Weight 
training can actually increase your flexibility if you perform the exercises through the full range of 
motion. I‘ve seen male bodybuilders weighing 230 pounds of solid muscle do full splits as part of their 
posing routines. As for the women, watch a professional fitness show like the Fitness Olympia. You‘ll 
see some of the most flexible athletes in the world, even though they train with weights every bit as 
hard as the men. 
If increasing flexibility is one of your fitness goals, then devote some time for stretching at the end 
of your lifting sessions and emphasize the tightest areas. An easy way to fit stretching into your 
routine with no extra time commitment is to stretch in between sets. Some people add yoga into their 
weekly plan to gain more flexibility. Just remember that yoga is a good adjunct to weight training, it‘s 
not a substitute for it. 
MYTH #7: WOMEN MUST TRAIN DIFFERENTLY FROM MEN. 

================================================================================
Most women who say they want to be ―toned‖ mean that they want to get fitter and firmer without 
getting bigger. Guess what? The best and fastest way to achieve the ―fitter and firmer‖ look women 
want is the same way that men achieve the ―muscular‖ look they want: with weight training. And 
without it, a woman will never get much stronger. 
A muscle either gets stronger and more developed or it doesn‘t. There‘s no such thing as ―toning‖ 
or gender-specific exercise; these are just the perceptions created by the fitness industry. I don‘t think 
that‘s a bad thing if it gets more women involved. What I‘m saying is that if women squat, lunge, row, 
press, and deadlift, just like men, they‘ll be rewarded with many times greater results than if they 
pursue some kind of dainty ―toning‖ exercises with three-pound pink dumbbells or follow exercise 
programs that don‘t use resistance at all. 
MYTH #8: YOU HAVE TO LIFT FOR HOURS EVERY DAY TO GET 
A GREAT BODY. 
You can finish an effective and thorough weight training workout in 60 minutes or less. While some 
people train longer for various reasons, and competitive athletes put in more hours a week than 
recreational lifters, more is not always better when it comes to resistance training. Short but intense 
workouts always produce great results, but intense training done too long or too often is 
counterproductive. Even if you could squeeze out more results by putting in more time, long workouts 
aren‘t practical for most people. 
If your time is limited, avoid the all-or-nothing mind-set and make the most of the time you have by 
working as hard and efficiently as possible. The obvious way is to reduce the number of exercises 
while maintaining or increasing the intensity. You can also use supersets, where you do two exercises 
in a row nonstop, or decrease rest intervals between sets. These techniques can help busy people get 
great results in as little as 30 to 45 minutes. 
MYTH #9: WEIGHT LIFTING WILL MAKE YOU SLOW AND 
UNATHLETIC. 
Weight training makes you a faster and better athlete. Stronger muscles can contract more quickly and 
produce more power. Athletes in almost every sport depend on weight training to improve their 
performance. Look at sprinters: They‘re the fastest people in the world, and heavy lifting is a major 
part of their training. 
Some strength coaches and athletes strongly endorse weight training but say that doing the wrong 
workouts will make you ―nonfunctional.‖ Outside of sport-specific training, ―functional‖ has become 
a buzzword in the fitness world, but the definition is fuzzy. Usually it means that you should train in a 
way that improves your ability to function well in daily life or perform better in your sport. 
If you‘re an athlete, you may need a specialized training program designed specifically for your 
sport, so consult your coach for advice. Strength and performance are top motivations for athletes, but 
looking great and getting healthier are the top motivations for everyone. The good news is it‘s not an 
either/or choice: With my program, you can have it all! You can get stronger, healthier, more 
functional—and get a killer body too. 

================================================================================
MYTH #10: YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS 
OVERWHELMED, UNCOMFORTABLE, CONFUSED, OR NOT SURE 
WHERE TO START. 
You have the knowledge of all the world‘s experts at your fingertips today on the Internet, but more 
than ever you‘re also drowning in a sea of conflicting opinions and information overload. It‘s normal 
to feel a little confused or overwhelmed at first. The good news is you can relax, because what would 
take months or even years to find online and pull together, you have right between the covers of this 
book. You can also trust that the information here is backed by science and experience. 
Even with a coach you trust and a plan you put faith in, most people feel a little intimidated when 
they first pick up the weights, especially in front of other people. I‘ve lost track of how many times I 
heard this: ―I would join a gym, but I have to get in shape first.‖ The irony there might make some 
people chuckle, but maybe you can relate. The important thing to remember is that discomfort is 
normal, not just in training, but in every new endeavor. You‘re uncomfortable the first time you do 
anything, but you must step outside your comfort zone to grow. 
THE NINE BURN THE FAT, FEED THE MUSCLE RESISTANCE 
TRAINING SUCCESS PRINCIPLES 
Now that you understand the importance of weight training in the fat-loss equation and we have all 
those pesky myths out of the way, we‘re ready to dive into the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle training 
plan. 
First, you‘ll learn the training principles. Fads come and go every year, but core principles never 
change. If you build your training plans on a foundation of principles, you will never go wrong. 
After the principles, we‘ll go on to the training plans. Start with the ―primer program‖ if you‘ve 
never lifted weights before. After that, I‘ll give you the new flagship training program of Burn the Fat, 
Feed the Muscle: the TNB-28 plan. 
Principle #1: Progressive Overload 
Progressive overload is the number one principle of all successful training programs. Progression 
means that, whenever it‘s possible, lift more weight, do more reps, do the same workout in less time, 
or increase the workload in some other way that your body is not accustomed to doing. Stated 
differently, overload means that you‘re going on a mission to continuously aim for personal 
improvement and new personal records (PRs). 
Any type of progressive overload can cause a positive adaptation—but progressive resistance, 
where you lift more weight than you have before, is the Holy Grail of building muscle and strength. 
It‘s not uncommon for beginners to add weight to the bar almost every week if not every workout. As 
you get more advanced, your improvements will naturally slow down to the point where progress must 
be coaxed slowly, in small increments every workout or even each week. PRs come even less often. 
Still, your goal remains the same: Keep challenging yourself. Keep improving. 
Using a repetition range (such as 8 to 12) is helpful for guiding progression. When you reach the 
upper end of your rep range, then it‘s time to increase the weight. Increasing reps, then weight, is 
known as the double progressive system. Here‘s an example of what slow progression on an exercise 
like the squat might look like: 

================================================================================
Weight in Pounds 
Reps 
Progression Stage 
225 
8 
Start at low end of rep range 
225 
9 
Increase by one rep 
225 
10 
Increase by one rep 
225 
11 
Increase by one rep 
225 
12 
Achieved rep goal; increase weight 
235 
8 
Drop back to low end of rep range 
235 
9 
Increase by one rep 
235 
10 
Increase by one rep 
235 
11 
Increase by one rep 
235 
12 
Achieved rep goal; increase weight 
245 
8 
Drop back to low end of rep range 
This is a simplified example. Your progress usually isn‘t this linear. More often, progress comes in 
spurts and then plateaus. You might jump three steps forward and then one step sideways (or back). 
Sometimes you‘ll make fast strength gains and increase the weight every workout. At other times, you 
must be patient and move up one rep at a time. If you add even one more rep with the same weight 
each workout, that‘s progress. 
When the honeymoon period of fast newbie gains is over, most people get frustrated at how long it 
takes to add even the smallest amounts of muscle or strength. But slow and steady is the secret to 
winning this race. Keep after it and be sure to track your progress using a written training journal. 
Each year, when you review your journal, you‘ll be amazed when you look at your PRs and see how 
far you‘ve come. 
The antithesis of progression is to go through the motions and repeat the same workout at the same 
workload over and over again. That might maintain your current condition, but it won‘t improve it. If 
you ever feel stuck, as if you‘re putting time into your workouts but not getting results, ask yourself 
how well you‘ve been applying this principle of progression. 

================================================================================
Write this on Post-it notes and add it to your affirmations list: ―I don’t go to the gym to maintain; I 
go to the gym to improve. And if I want to improve, then today I must aim to beat my previous 
workouts and do something I’ve never done before.‖ 
Not every workout should be 100 percent and you can‘t always increase the weight, but you can 
develop a constant improvement mind-set and a low tolerance for standing still. That makes training 
much more exciting, challenging, and motivating. 
Principle #2: Intensity 
Training intensity is the amount of effort you exert—or, if you prefer, hard work! If you‘ve selected 
the right amount of weight, the last two or three reps in a set should be difficult. You‘ll feel fatigue, 
the burn intensifies, the weight feels heavier, and it gets harder and harder to finish each rep. If your 
rep range goal is 8 to 12 and you hit the upper rep number—12—and it feels easy, the weight is too 
light and the set was not intense. If you stop when you still have three, four, or more reps left in you, 
then you‘re not challenging yourself. If you push yourself through the ―good pain‖ of burn and fatigue 
to squeeze out those last reps, it can make the difference between a great body and an average body. 
If you continue a set to complete fatigue, you‘ll hit a point where you momentarily can‘t do another 
rep. In lifter‘s lingo, that‘s known as reaching ―failure.‖ Whether you should push yourself this hard is 
a topic of great controversy. The science tells us that training to failure can increase muscle fiber 
recruitment, muscle tension, metabolic stress, and anabolic hormone release, which can all contribute 
to better muscle gains. However, training to failure all the time could lead to overtraining and mental 
burnout. As long as you keep using the progressive overload principle, you‘ll keep making progress 
whether you reach failure or not. 
The ideal method is to include intense training (to failure) during some but not all of your workouts 
as part of a training cycle. This gives you the benefits of failure training without the overuse problems. 
When you train to failure, be sure to do it safely and intelligently. If you train alone, don‘t train to 
failure on exercises where you could get stuck under the bar. Use a spotter when you need one and 
never, ever push through the ―bad pain‖ of injury. 
Principle #3: Optimal Resistance 
―Resistance training‖ is the general term used for lifting any kind of weight or working against any 
form of resistance, including your body (as in pull-ups or push-ups), elastic bands, and so on. An 
advantage of weight training is being able to measure and monitor the load down to the pound. 
Choosing the right amount of weight is important for getting the results you want. 
The traditional way to calculate your optimal training load is the one-rep maximum test. It‘s exactly 
what it sounds like: You build up to the heaviest weight you can lift one time and that‘s your one-rep 
max. When you know your one-rep max, then you choose your training load based on a percentage of 
it. The traditional prescription is: 
70 percent or less = light 
70 percent to 85 percent = moderate 
85 percent or higher = heavy 
The one-rep max and percentage method are still widely used in strength sports, but to simplify this 
program and avoid the need for heavy one-rep max testing, the loads in this workout are simply 
dictated by a rep max range or bracket: 

================================================================================
The 4 to 7 rep max range is considered heavy and is associated with the strength workouts. 
The 8 to 12 rep max range is considered medium and is associated with the muscle workouts. 
The 13 to 20 rep max range is light and associated with the endurance workouts. 
What separates this program from many others is that we use a combination of rep ranges instead of 
one prescription such as 3 sets of 10 or 5 sets of 5. Working in more than one rep range gives you the 
best overall results because it develops greater strength as well as greater muscle development. 
Adding in some occasional lighter sets can be helpful for giving your joints a break, building 
endurance, and inducing circulation, but it‘s a mistake to drop all your heavy work. Doing high reps 
with light weights will not develop muscle definition or burn more fat; you can add that to the lifting-
myths column. 
Principle #4: Optimal Rep Range 
Choose a repetition bracket based on your goals or the effect you want to produce. To get stronger, 
athletes do a lot of training in the 4 to 7 rep range with heavy weights. Training in the 8 to 12 rep 
range with moderate weights is ideal for muscle growth. If you want muscular endurance or pump 
(increased blood flushing into the muscle), work in the 13 to 20 rep range. 
Most people want both strength and muscle, and that‘s one reason why it makes sense to train in 
multiple rep ranges, either in the same workout (concurrent) or alternating (undulating). I recommend 
doing both; that‘s why there are strength days and ―muscle‖ (hypertrophy) days in this program. 
The simplest and easiest way to get started is to choose one rep range such as 3 × 8–12 (three sets of 
8 to 12 reps) or, in the case of our muscle primer program, 10 to 15 reps. Giving yourself a range lets 
you know when it‘s time to increase the weight and helps you use the progressive resistance principle. 
Rep Category 
Rep Range 
Weight 
Benefit 
Low 
4–7 
Heavy 
Maximum strength 
Medium 
8–12 
Moderate 
Maximum muscle development, some strength 
High 
13–20 
Light 
Muscular endurance, metabolic conditioning, little strength 
Principle #5: Optimal Volume 
There‘s no question that one set per exercise can produce results if the intensity is high enough. But as 
more studies have been done over the years, research has validated what I and other athletes have 
discovered through experience: The optimal approach is to do multiple sets of each exercise. In a 
review published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, author James Krieger 
concluded that multiple sets are associated with a 40 percent greater increase in muscle growth as 
compared to the single set approach. 
Three sets per exercise has been a best practice for decades, but there‘s no reason you can‘t do two 
sets or four sets per exercise. Five sets of five is actually one of the most popular strength workouts. 

================================================================================
For strength workouts, when the reps are low, the number of sets per exercise is sometimes increased 
to keep the total training volume up. The total number of sets in a workout can also vary based on the 
body part. Larger muscle groups like your back can handle more volume than smaller muscle groups 
like your biceps. 
Principle #6: Optimal Rest Intervals 
As a generalization, rest intervals can be described as very short (30 seconds), short (1 minute), 
medium (2 minutes), or long (3 minutes). If you‘re training for muscle, resting 60 to 90 seconds 
between sets is a good rule of thumb. That gives you enough time to recoup your energy and work 
capacity just enough to perform the next set without too much residual fatigue from the last set. If 
you‘re training for strength, it‘s ideal to extend rest intervals between sets to two or three minutes. 
This lets you recover more fully so you can do each subsequent set with maximum strength, but it‘s 
not so long that you start cooling off. You can use a wristwatch or timer if you want, but don‘t have to 
time your rest periods exactly; just get as close as you can and remember the general rule. 
In some cases, there are advantages to reducing your rest intervals to as little as 30 seconds. 
Obviously, short rest periods between sets are a time-saver. Doing more work in less time is known as 
increasing training density. It burns more calories in less time and it‘s a way to use progressive 
overload without having to increase weight. The disadvantage is that short rest intervals provide 
incomplete recovery between sets and dramatically reduce the amount of weight you can use, which is 
not as conducive to strength gains. 
Cutting all the rest between every set of every exercise would be circuit training, which is good for 
fitness conditioning and time efficiency, but then you‘re no longer doing true strength training; it‘s 
more like doing cardio with weights. On TNB-28, we keep cardio and strength training separate and 
distinct. A superset is where you perform two exercises in a row with no rest between them. You rest 
after the second exercise. In this program we superset the arm exercises. For busy people who want to 
finish their workouts faster and don‘t mind the compromise, including more supersets and reducing 
rest intervals are great efficiency techniques. 
Principle #7: Optimal Tempo 
Tempo is how fast or slow you do each repetition. We‘re going to keep it simple and use a two-point 
tempo prescription: lifting (concentric) and lowering (eccentric). 
The concentric action is where you lift the weight and the muscle shortens or contracts. For 
example, when you curl a barbell up, that‘s the concentric part of the rep, where your bicep contracts 
and shortens. The concentric part of the rep should be done quickly but under control. It usually takes 
one to two seconds to lift the weight, depending on the exercise. As your muscles get fatigued toward 
the end of the set, it‘s normal for the movement to slow down as you struggle to finish the final reps. 
The eccentric action is where you lower the weight back down and the muscle lengthens. If you go 
a little slower on the way down (eccentric emphasis), this may help increase your strength and muscle 
gains. A typical eccentric action is about two or three seconds, which simply means that you should 
lower the weight a little more slowly than you lift it. An easy way to remember this is to ―fight 
gravity‖ on the way down instead of dropping the weight quickly. 
Some trainers have taken this method to the extreme and promote ―super-slow‖ reps, which may 
take 10 or 15 seconds to complete. It might sound like a good idea at first, but it‘s counterproductive 
to do your reps too slowly. Aside from being a tedious way to train, the biggest problem is that you 
have to use weights that are so light, you don‘t trigger the muscle response you want. 

================================================================================
Principle #8: Variation 
Changing your overall workout structure and individual exercises regularly helps prevent you from 
getting bored and losing motivation. It lets you work your body from various angles with different 
training stimuli. It also helps you avoid plateaus from adaptation and keeps the progress coming. 
Beginners can get results on the same workout for months before seeing the progress curve flatten. 
The more years you‘ve been training (training age) and the more conditioned your body becomes, the 
faster your body adapts to each new stimulus and the more you‘ll benefit from frequent variation. 
On the other hand, you don‘t want to change workouts too often. By constantly hopping from one 
program to another, you don‘t establish continuity from one workout to the next, you don‘t allow time 
for progression on each exercise, you don‘t optimize your strength gains, and you really don‘t know 
what‘s working and what‘s not. 
There are potential benefits to changing something in your workout every day, but don‘t change 
everything and don‘t change at random for no reason. Milk each routine for all it‘s worth before 
switching to the next one. You can stay on the same program as long as it keeps working for you, but 
as a best practice, every 12 weeks is a good time for an overhaul involving changing some of the 
exercises and trying new training tactics. Beginners should stick with their initial program for at least 
three months. As your training age increases, you may want to make changes as often as every four 
weeks. 
Principle #9: Periodization 
At its simplest level, periodization is planning. It means you never go into the gym without knowing 
what you‘ll be doing and what your goals are for the workout. Going deeper, periodization means a 
special type of planning where you structure your program in blocks, phases, or cycles and you change 
the training variables regularly in a way that maximizes your strength and muscle gains while 
minimizing plateaus and injuries. A nice bonus: It keeps your workouts interesting and prevents 
boredom or burnout. 
This typically means rotating or periodically changing loads, reps, exercises, and intensity. That 
might seem complicated, but the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle program makes periodization easy. 
We use it in several simple but effective ways: We cycle intensity in 4-week (28-day) blocks, rotate 
exercises, change repetition ranges, and alternate heavy and moderate workouts, with a few lighter 
ones thrown in for good measure. Our way borrows techniques from both the strength training world 
and the physique world, so it‘s ideal for body transformation goals. What‘s most important to know is 
that a program using periodization is always more effective than one that doesn‘t. 
PUTTING THE PRINCIPLES INTO PRACTICE 
This may have seemed like a lot of details to take in, especially for a beginner. Anyone new to weight 
training might want to go back and review the information more than once before getting started on 
the workouts. Because these are foundational principles and not training fads that come and go like the 
latest fashion, it‘s well worth it for advanced trainees to review as well. No matter what your level of 
experience, in the next chapter you‘ll see how easy these principles are to follow and how they all 
come together seamlessly into a practical plan. 

================================================================================
CHAPTER 17 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle 
Weight Training: The Program 
If you could have only one reason to make strength training part of your fitness life, you might try 
this fact: It is the only way to reshape your body. Attempting to transform a body with cardio alone is 
futile. 
—Shawn Phillips, author of Strength for Life 
FROM PRINCIPLES TO ACTION 
In the last chapter, we dispelled the most common myths that prevent people from starting a weight 
training program or from doing it most efficiently. We also listed the nine training principles that are 
most important to your fastest body transformation and continuous progress. That gives you all the 
background details and tools you need to start building, so in this chapter we are jumping right into the 
workout. 
I first want to reemphasize that this entire program is built on principles. Change is a constant. 
You‘ll always need to change your workouts to prevent plateaus. You‘ll need new ideas to avoid 
boredom. You‘ll always be cycling the acute training variables such as choice of exercise, intensity, 
volume, and repetition ranges, just to keep progress coming. But those changes in methods take place 
on top of a bedrock-solid foundation of experience and science-based principles, not on the most 
fashionable current trends. The core concepts worked decades ago. They work today. They‘ll still 
work decades from now. 
In this chapter, I‘m going to give you the flagship training program of Burn the Fat, Feed the 
Muscle: The New Body 28 (TNB-28) plan, which puts all these principles into action. The program 
uses a template that‘s plug-and-play simple. The cycle lasts 28 days, but it doesn‘t end after 28 days: 
You can plug in new variables and continue on to your next level by repeating these four-week cycles. 
I‘m thrilled to welcome men and women who are new to weight training to this program and to our 
community. For the beginners, we‘ll start with a simple and easy but ultraeffective workout called the 
Muscle Primer Plan. Enjoy the beginner gains: It‘s the most exciting time to make quick progress! 
Combined with Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle nutrition, mental training, and cardio training, even this 
basic starter program can produce dramatic results in the first 28 days. 
THE MUSCLE PRIMER SCHEDULE 
If you have at least three to six months of consistent training experience, then you can skip right ahead 
to the TNB-28 plan. If not, start with this muscle primer plan which is perfect for beginners or anyone 
who has been away from lifting for a long time. 
You‘ll train your whole body at each workout, three days per week, on nonconsecutive days, such 
as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. If you‘ve never lifted 
weights before, you can break in slowly the first week and do one set your first day, two sets your 

================================================================================
second day, and three sets on your third day. This gives a beginner‘s body the first week to acclimate 
to the new stress and prevent excessive muscle soreness. By week two, you‘ll being doing three sets of 
each exercise.

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED 
I‘ve chosen each exercise for a reason. They‘re not only the most effective and essential movements 
everyone needs to learn (squat, dead lift, press, row, etc.), I‘ve chosen a variation of each exercise 
that‘s easy for a beginner to master and that can be done at home with minimal equipment. All you 
need is dumbbells. 
Dumbbells (free weights that some people know as ―hand weights‖) are a fantastic training tool on 
many levels. They encourage equal development on each side of the body, they allow natural, 
unrestricted range of movement, they require more activation in the stabilizer muscles, and they‘re 
great for every type of fitness goal. You can use them in a gym or at home, and if you lack space at 
home, you can get dumbbell handles that take weight plates of increasing sizes. You can also use 
adjustable dumbbell sets where one pair is the equivalent of an entire rack of solid dumbbells 
(examples: PowerBlock or Bowflex SelectTech). 
Dumbbells will never go out of style: They are the first and best resistance training equipment 
investment you can make. You can buy dumbbells at any fitness or sporting goods store or even shop 
for them online. You can buy a whole rack all at once, or you can add heavier sets one or two pairs at 
a time as you get stronger. If you plan to continue training at home, I recommend adding a fully 
adjustable bench, which will allow you to challenge yourself with a wider variety of weight training 
exercises when body weight exercises like push-ups get too easy. Add a soft mat for floor exercises, 
and you have everything you need. 
WARM-UP AND STRETCHING 
It‘s important to warm up before each weight training session. Warming up raises your body 
temperature, increases joint mobility, stimulates blood flow, and increases your physical and mental 
readiness for the workout ahead. 
The traditional way to warm up is to hop on a cardio machine for five to ten minutes. That‘s fine as 
a general warm-up, especially on lower-body day, but another option is joint mobility drills or 
dynamic flexibility exercises. Arm circles, trunk circles, leg swings, Spider-Man steps, squat to stand, 
body weight lunges, and so on not only warm you up, they also increase mobility and flexibility in the 
joints you‘re about to train. You can see these and other warm-ups in the free exercise demos at 
www.burnthefatfeedthemuscle.com/freetools.html. 
To increase your performance and decrease risk of injury, do at least one or two light, nonfatiguing 
sets of each exercise before moving on to your heavy work sets. It‘s not wise to jump right to your 
heaviest set or attempt a personal record if you‘re still cold. 

================================================================================
It‘s important to remember that static stretching is for increasing flexibility, not for warming up. In 
fact, an ideal time to stretch is after you‘re already warm. That‘s why most athletes do warm-up and 
mobility exercises before lifting and do static stretching after the workout. 
MUSCLE PRIMER PLAN EXERCISES 
The exercises in the primer plan are so basic that they‘re self-explanatory or already familiar to people 
who have lifted weights before. However, any kind of free weights, even dumbbells, can be 
intimidating for a first timer, so I‘ve listed the exercises below with a description of the form. I‘ve put 
additional training information on the website for free. You can see photos of every exercise with

================================================================================
1. Dumbbell Split Squat (Thighs): 3 sets × 10–15 reps 
Holding a dumbbell in each hand, step forward into a lunge (split) position, with one leg in front and 
one leg in back. Squat down, lowering your back knee until it almost touches the floor. Stand back up, 
keeping a slight bend in your front leg so you maintain tension on your thighs. 

================================================================================
 

================================================================================
 

================================================================================
2. Romanian Dead Lift with Dumbbells (Hamstrings/Lower Back): 3 sets × 10–15 reps 
Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing your body (pronated). Stand up tall with your 
feet no wider than shoulder width apart. Slowly bend forward, hinging at the waist. Keep your knees 
slightly bent and the dumbbells close to your body as you bend forward and lower the weights toward 
the floor. Keep your entire core tight and maintain a neutral back position, which means a flat back or 
slight arch in your lower back; do not round over your back. Return to the standing-straight-up starting 
position. 

================================================================================

================================================================================

================================================================================
3. One-Arm Dumbbell Row (Upper Back): 3 sets × 10–15 reps 
Grab one dumbbell with your right hand and place your left hand on a bench, chair, or ledge for 
support. Step back with your right leg so you have a stable support base. From arm‘s length, pull the 
dumbbell up to your waist. Keep your palm facing your body and keep your head up and back flat 
throughout the exercise. Slowly lower the dumbbell back down until your arm is straight and you feel 
a stretch. Switch arms and repeat. 
 

================================================================================
 

================================================================================
4. Dumbbell Bench Press (Chest): 3 sets × 10–15 reps 
Grab a set of dumbbells and lie on your back on a bench. Begin with the dumbbells at arm‘s length 
over your chest, palms facing toward your feet. Lower the dumbbells to the sides of your chest, then 
press them back up to the starting position. If you train at home and don‘t have a bench, you can 
substitute push-ups for the bench press. Since it‘s a body weight exercise, you can keep increasing 
your reps beyond 15 each week instead of adding weight. 
 
 

================================================================================
5. Dumbbell Overhead Press (Shoulders): 3 sets × 10–15 reps 
Grab a set of dumbbells and sit on the edge of a bench or chair. Begin with the dumbbells at shoulder 
height with your palms facing away from your body. Press the dumbbells up until your arms are 
straight overhead. Slowly lower back to the starting position. You can also do this exercise standing. 

================================================================================
 

================================================================================
 

================================================================================
6. Overhead Dumbbell Extension (Triceps): 3 sets × 10–15 reps 
Standing, or sitting on the edge of a chair, hold a single dumbbell between both hands, cupping the 
weight so one side of the bell rests in the palms of your hand. Start with the weight over your head and 
your arms fully extended. Lower the dumbbell behind your head by bending at the elbows. Push the 
dumbbell back over your head (extend) until your arms are straight again. 
 

================================================================================
 

================================================================================
7. Dumbbell Curl (Biceps): 3 sets × 10–15 reps 
Standing with your feet shoulder width apart, or seated on the edge of a bench or chair, hold a 
dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing up. Curl both dumbbells up together to shoulder height. 
At the top of the movement, your palms should be facing upward. Hold the contraction briefly and 
squeeze the biceps, then slowly return the dumbbells to the starting position. Keep your torso vertical 
and avoid leaning backward. 

================================================================================
 

================================================================================
 

================================================================================
8. Single Leg Calf Raise with Dumbbell (Calves): 3 sets × 15–20 reps 
Stand on the edge of a step, a block of wood, or a thick book with the ball of your right foot on the 
edge. Holding a dumbbell in your right hand, rise up on the ball of your foot as high as you can go. 
Drop your heel below the edge until you feel a slight stretch in your calf. Repeat for the desired 
number of reps; then, without stopping, switch to the left leg and repeat. 

================================================================================
 

================================================================================

================================================================================
9. Plank (Abs/Core): 3 sets × 30–60 seconds 
Lie on your stomach on an exercise mat or carpeted surface. Prop your body up on your forearms and 
position your body in a straight line from head to feet. Hold the straight line position with your body 
several inches off the floor for 30 seconds. Increase your hold time by 10 seconds each week until you 
reach 1 minute per set (hold longer if you‘re an overachiever). 
 

================================================================================
10. Crunches or Bicycle Crunches (Abs): 3 sets × 15–20 reps 
Lie flat on your back on a mat or soft surface with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor (or your 
heels on the edge of a bench or chair). Put your hands behind your head, touching your fingers to the 
back of your head. Raise your head, shoulders, and upper back off the floor in a curling motion, 
contracting your abdominals. To avoid neck strain, avoid pulling on the back of your head. To involve 
the oblique muscles on the side of the waist more heavily, perform the bicycle crunch variation, where 
you perform the crunch with a twist, touching your elbow to your opposite knee. 
 

================================================================================
 
ADJUSTING THE WEIGHT AND REPS 
In the last chapter I explained how to select the right amount of weight (principle number 3). It‘s 
important to get this right because making progress is all about applying the proper resistance. Keep in 
mind that it may take a couple of sets or even a couple of workouts to adjust the initial poundage. 
An advantage of working in a rep range is that it helps you choose the right weight. If your target 
rep range is 10 to 15 reps, then you should be able to do at least the lower number (10). If you can 
only do 6 reps, for example, the weight is too heavy. If you can hit the upper number in the range (15) 
and it was easy, that‘s your signal that the weight was too light, so you should increase it. 
In the primer phase, the reps for most of the exercises are a little higher (10‒15) because that allows 
you more opportunity to practice proper form and ingrain the new movement patterns into your 
nervous system. 
WHEN TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT WORKOUT 
Follow this program for the first three months. Some people find it tedious to continue with the same 
exercise for two or three months, so if you feel your progress is plateauing after the first or second 
month or you‘re losing motivation, then switch the exercises. Stick with the same exercises if you‘re 
enjoying the workouts and still progressing in weight and reps. After three months on the primer plan, 
you‘ll be ready for TNB-28. 

================================================================================
There‘s nothing wrong with staying with a full-body workout for up to six months or longer if you 
continue to get great results from it and the simplicity of full-body training suits your style. What 
you‘ll need to do, however, is rotate your exercises every 4 to 12 weeks and continue to use the 
progressive overload, intensity, and variation principles. You‘ll also benefit from implementing the 
periodization principle, alternating heavy-rep-range and medium-rep-range workouts every other 
session or scheduling a heavy, medium, and light day for each of your three workouts. 
INTRODUCING TNB-28 
Most people are not interested in building the mass of a heavyweight bodybuilder and they certainly 
aren‘t going to tan up, pump up, and flex in posing trunks or a teeny bikini onstage under a spotlight. 
But I‘ve never met anyone who wasn‘t interested in staying lean and developing a more sculpted 
physique. I developed the TNB-28 plan with that in mind. 
This program borrows some of the most effective techniques from bodybuilding and physique 
sports, used by the leanest, most muscular people in the world, and combines them in a program that 
fits the goals and lifestyle of the regular guy or girl. It‘s designed to work equally well for men and 
women, and to be done in a gym or at home (some equipment is required). You can easily modify it to 
fit busy schedules. 
Follow it and you‘ll get stronger and leaner and completely transform your body shape. Guys will 
achieve the natural muscular look (think Men’s Fitness cover model or all-natural bodybuilder if you 
want to take it further). Girls will sculpt a curvaceous ―hard body‖ with feminine muscle in all the 
right places in just the right amount. (Have you seen what figure athletes look like?) 
Wherever your body is now, this plan will take your physique to the next level. The TNB-28 
program will challenge you even if you‘re already in good shape, because you can increase the 
difficulty level and repeat the 28-day cycles more than once, each time hitting new personal records 
and new peaks in your condition. I‘ll give you tips to customize the program so it fits your level of 
experience the best. 
In all my years as a fitness pro, TNB-28 is the most popular, most effective, most talked-about type 
of resistance training program I‘ve ever created. It‘s been tested behind the scenes in our Inner Circle 
community for years, and what you‘re getting here is the newest evolution of the plan. TNB-28 is the 
lean-muscle training program of the future. 
EQUIPMENT NEEDED 
This program uses a mix of barbells, dumbbells, and weight machines. You can do it in a gym or you 
can follow it at home with basic equipment. If you don‘t have access to all the machines, you can 
easily substitute an equivalent free-weight exercise. For example, if you don‘t have a cable pulley 
machine for triceps push-downs, you can do a barbell or dumbbell triceps extension. If you don‘t have 
a lat pull-down machine, you can do dumbbell rows, dumbbell pull-overs, or even inverted rows under 
a sturdy table. You can also go off the TNB-28 exercise list and pick any alternate exercise you want. 
EXERCISES 
Changing exercises and other program variables at least every few months gives your body new 
challenges and keeps training fun and interesting. 

================================================================================
There are a handful of very important basic movement patterns including squats, lunges (split 
squats), dead lifts, rows, pull-ups, chest presses, and shoulder (overhead) presses. Master them. These 
exercises should always be a major part of your training plans. However, there are countless variations 
on each of these movements: barbell and dumbbell versions, different stance or grip positions, 
different bars, and so on. You can use these variations on the basics to mix things up without getting 
away from the primary movements. 
The ―big lifts‖—multi-joint, compound exercises such as squats, dead lifts, rows, and presses—
have the highest calorie burn and are the most effective muscle builders. They‘re also the most 
challenging. Single-joint isolation exercises like leg extensions and small-muscle exercises like 
concentration curls can be a part of any weight training program and they‘re especially useful for 
bodybuilding and fine-tuning physique details. But avoiding the difficult exercises like squats in favor 
of the easier ones like leg extensions is a sure way to short-circuit your results. 
Adding more exercises on top of a beginner routine is another method of progressive overload. But 
more isn‘t always better. For example, in workout one of the TNB-28 plan, there‘s only one exercise 
for biceps and one for triceps. In their eagerness to build arms like Mr. Olympia, many lifters add a 
second or even a third exercise for the arms or they double the number of sets. On a two-day split with 
four workouts per week, this is unnecessary. Between one direct exercise and all the pushing you do 
on shoulder and chest exercises and all the pulling for back exercises, your biceps and triceps get 
plenty of stimulation. If you add too many more exercises, your workouts take a lot longer and could 
lead to overtraining. 
The following exercise menu includes all of the exercises listed in the primer workout and the TNB-
28 workout. Underneath, you‘ll also find exercises that you can use as alternates, based on your 
equipment availability and preferences. TNB-28 is a workout template. When it comes time for a new 
routine, you simply choose new exercises and plug them in. To see proper form for all the exercises,

THE EXERCISE ROTATION SYSTEM 
One feature that sets TNB-28 apart from others is the exercise rotation technique. This means that the 
program is actually two workouts, not one. Every other workout, you rotate between the two. For 
example, on workout one you do chin-ups, and on workout two you do lat pull-downs. There are huge 
benefits to this system. 
First, it‘s a boredom killer. There is nothing wrong with working the same exercises for months as 
long as you can keep applying the progressive overload principle. The problem is many people get 
bored and lose motivation even if they‘re still getting results. Rotating between two workouts keeps it 
interesting a lot longer. 
Rotating exercises also helps you avoid overuse injuries caused by repetitive pattern overload. If 
you do the same exercises week after week for months on end, especially if you train hard and heavy, 
eventually your joints take a beating. Joint pain from training is common, and rotating exercises (in 
addition to alternating heavy and lighter workouts) may help alleviate it. 
By rotating some of the exercises you also all hit your muscles from a variety of angles and planes 
with different equipment (barbells, dumbbells, cables, and so on). This helps stimulate the maximum 
number of muscle fibers and develops every part of every muscle. The variety also helps slow down 
the adaptations that lead to plateaus, so you keep getting results longer. 
In TNB-28, not all of the exercises are rotated, which keeps this plan a little simpler and easier. For 
example, you stay with basic movements like squats through the whole program (you rotate the rep 
ranges), and only the second leg exercise is rotated. As you get more advanced, rotating two workouts 
that are 100 percent different is an option. 
THE TWO-DAY SPLIT ROUTINE 
The TNB-28 program uses a two-day split routine, in which you divide your workout into an upper-
body day and a lower-body plus abs day. Why not stick with a full-body workout? You could, but 
beyond the beginner stage, your body will respond best when you accumulate a higher volume of 
work. Splitting your body in two gives you time in each workout to add those additional sets and 
exercises. As you advance, it‘s also important to use more variation in the training stimulus, both in 
rep ranges and exercises. These goals are difficult to achieve with full-body workouts, without turning 
them into marathon 90- to 120-minute sessions. 
Split routines also allow you to focus your mental and physical energies more efficiently. Training 
your entire body in a single session can be exhausting. When you only have to work half your body, 
you can give more energy and intensity to each muscle group. There‘s a little more volume to be done 
on the upper-body days, but since leg training is so demanding, it‘s better that the volume is lower on 
leg day. It also leaves you plenty of time to do a thorough job on your abs. 

================================================================================
THE WEEKLY WORKOUT SCHEDULE (FREQUENCY) 
TNB-28 calls for four workouts per week: 
Day 1: upper-body strength and muscle 
Day 2: lower-body strength and muscle 
Day 3: upper-body muscle 
Day 4: lower-body muscle 
Mon.

2. Lower-body strength/muscle

3. Upper-body muscle 
4. Lower-body muscle 
Off 
Off 
This is an ideal weekly schedule for most people because it gives you an extra day of total rest from 
resistance training between the third and fourth day, which enhances overall recovery. It also leaves 
weekends open. This schedule has some room for flexibility. If you prefer, you can change the days of 
the week you train, moving workouts to the weekend or inserting an off day in between two training 
days. 
THREE-DAYS-PER-WEEK OPTION 
If you‘re pressed for time, or if you feel you don‘t recover completely from four workouts a week, you 
can reduce this schedule to three workouts every seven days. You would simply train on any three 
nonconsecutive days per week, such as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (or Tuesday, Thursday, 
Saturday). With a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule, you would do workout 1 on Monday, 
workout 2 on Wednesday, workout 3 on Friday, workout 4 on the following Monday, and then repeat 
the cycle.

THE FOUR-WEEK PERIODIZATION CYCLE 
This is a four-week program that changes rep ranges within the week and progresses weekly in load 
and intensity. On strength and muscle days you‘ll do a mix of heavy sets for 4 to 7 reps and muscle 
sets for 8 to 12 reps. On muscle days, you‘ll do sets of mostly 8 to 12 reps and an occasional higher 
rep set. There are no low-rep-only (strength) days because this is a body transformation program, not a 
powerlifting or strength sports program. However, there‘s enough heavy work to guarantee you‘ll get 
a lot stronger. You‘ll progress through the following four one-week cycles: 
WEEK 1: INTRODUCTORY LOADING 
You‘ll be introduced to the new exercises and training techniques. The loads are submaximal. For 
example, if you estimate that you can do 10 reps with 100 pounds, you would select only 90 pounds. 
The intensity level is low, which means you won‘t take any sets to failure: You‘ll complete the entire 
set easily. 
WEEK 2: BASE LOADING 
You‘ll increase the load in every exercise whenever possible. The intensity level will be moderate, 
which means you‘ll come close to failure on your hypertrophy sets and the final reps of each set will 
be hard. 
WEEK 3: OVERLOADING 
You‘ll increase the loading again to above your previous max, whenever possible while maintaining 
good form. Your goal is to start beating your previous week‘s bests. The final reps of each set will be 
very hard, and this week, you‘ll probably hit failure on some of your sets. 
WEEK 4: SHOCK (PR) LOADING 
You‘ll once again increase the load above the previous week‘s bests and aim to hit some personal 
records (PRs). Intensity is very high. This is where you push yourself. You‘ll take many of your sets 
to failure and you may miss some reps (for example, your goal is 8 to 12 reps but you barely got 7). If 
you have any favorite high-intensity techniques such as forced reps or drop sets, this is when to use 
them. 
WEEK 5: BEGIN NEW CYCLE 
You can repeat the four-week cycle by starting over again with introductory loading (submaximal load 
and no sets taken to failure). At this point you‘ll be stronger, so your introductory phase will be at 
least equal to your previous base-loading phase. With each cycle, you continue to increase the weights 
used as your newfound strength allows. 
WHAT’S NEXT AFTER TNB-28? 
Most people can keep getting amazing results on the TNB-28 plan for months—even years. The 
training template and weekly schedule never go bad. Simply continue focusing on progressive 
overload, and keep challenging yourself to hit new personal records. 

================================================================================
I recommend you repeat the program for at least three four-week cycles (12 weeks). After 12 
weeks, most people will start experiencing significant adaptation, so it‘s time for a change. Stick with 
the TNB-28 weekly schedule and set/rep guidelines, but change some (or all) of the exercises. Rinse 
and repeat as long as it‘s still working well for you. 
Men and women who are interested in competition-level figure or bodybuilding training may want 
to move on to advanced three- and four-day body part split routines. You can learn more about these 
advanced physique programs on the website at www.burnthefatfeedthemuscle.com/freetools.html and 
at our private members-only support community at www.BurnTheFatInnerCircle.com. 
WEIGHT TRAINING CUSTOMIZATION 
You can follow these routines exactly as outlined or customize them to suit your situation better. If 
you prefer different exercises or training techniques, by all means, use them. Burn the Fat, Feed the 
Muscle nutrition works well with other weight training programs and even body weight resistance 
programs. The important thing is that you always include the resistance training element of our four-
part fat-loss formula. If you‘re not doing some form of resistance training, you‘re not doing Burn the 
Fat, Feed the Muscle. 
Consider this training program as a great starting point. No training plan can remain the same and 
keep working forever. You may move to other weekly split routines or stay with this one, but no 
matter what schedule you follow, to prevent staleness or muscle adaptation, you must periodically 
change the other variables: exercises, exercise combinations, exercise order, intensity, sets, reps, rest 
intervals, poundage, and so on. The number of potential workouts you can create by mixing these 
training variables is infinite. 
We‘ve covered a lot of ground in this chapter, and you have everything you need to get started. 
Advanced program design is a complex subject, and the more years you‘ve been training, the more 
variation and sophistication you need to keep making progress. So I encourage you to become a 
serious student and keep testing different techniques. Become your own science project, and 
remember: The results of your own personal experiments are what matter more than anything else.

Breaking Plateaus 

================================================================================
If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always got. If what you are doing is not 
working, do something else. 
—Joseph O’Connor and John Seymour, Introducing NLP [Neuro-Linguistic Programming] 
UNDERSTANDING FAT-LOSS PLATEAUS 
You‘ve made progress for weeks or even months and things are going great: You‘re lighter, leaner, 
and already looking a lot fitter. Then, for no apparent reason, your fat loss slows down. The next thing 
you know, your progress stops completely, but you haven‘t reached your goal yet. You still have fat 
you want to get rid of. You don‘t understand what‘s going on because you‘re following the same 
program that was working before. 
To the best of your knowledge, you haven‘t fallen off track. You had some cheat meals each week, 
but you built those into your plan and never overdid it. You haven‘t skipped any workouts either. But 
there they are: the last stubborn pounds of fat, defiantly clinging to your lower abs, love handles, hips, 
or thighs—ironically, the places you want that fat gone the most. That‘s when it dawns on you: ―I‘ve 
hit a fat-loss plateau.‖ 
At that point, many people think there‘s something wrong with them. ―Maybe it‘s my thyroid,‖ they 
wonder. ―Do I have a slow metabolism? Am I one of those extreme endomorphs that can‘t be helped? 
Maybe getting really lean just isn‘t in the cards for me.‖ It‘s normal to feel frustration and have these 
types of doubts when progress stops coming. But getting through plateaus is as much psychological as 
it is physical. When you‘re stuck, that‘s when it‘s more important than ever to redouble your 
commitment, stay focused on your goal, and be positive. That‘s plateau-breaking strategy number one. 
Discouragement and frustration cause many people to give up even though they‘re so close to the 
finish line. They would have easily broken through with a shift in attitude and an extra dose of 
persistence. Many people also quit when they stall because they don‘t understand the real reasons why 
plateaus happen and they don‘t know about all the strategies they can use to break through them and 
reach the next level. The good news is those strategies are now right at your fingertips in this chapter 
and the next. 
The bad news about plateaus is that they‘re common. In fact, you should expect them. You‘re more 
likely to zigzag your way to your goal, with sticking points and good weeks and bad weeks, than you 
are to shoot to your goal in a straight line without a hiccup. Fortunately, if you understand how 
plateaus are a normal part of the way your body adapts, it won‘t bother you so much. You‘ll simply 
make the right adjustment, get back to work for another week, and be back on target. 
Before we look at the specific techniques for breaking plateaus and keeping progress coming week 
after week, let‘s first look at why progress stalls in the first place. 
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL REASONS FOR PLATEAUS 
In the majority of cases, a faulty thyroid gland or a slow metabolism is not the cause of stalled fat loss. 
Lack of compliance is the biggest reason for fat-loss plateaus and slower-than-expected weight loss. 
Stated differently, you didn‘t follow your plan closely enough—and you may not have realized it. 
Your goal is to see some kind of positive result every week. If you‘re getting no results after seven 
days, before considering a change, the first thing to do is check your compliance to your current plan. 
Ask yourself honestly: ―Have I been doing everything I need to do every day or am I missing 
something? Have I done my best or could I have given it more? Have I been consistent in my eating 

================================================================================
habits every day or eating well one day and poorly the next? Am I doing a great job all week, then 
blowing it on the weekends?‖ The cause of your plateau may be uncovered with the answers to these 
simple questions. 
When you‘re rating yourself for compliance, remember to rate yourself in all four areas: 
1.  Mental training. Do you have a current set of updated goals in writing, and have you been 
keeping your goals in front of you, reading them every day? 
2.  Cardio training. Do you have a customized cardio schedule and have you been following it 
consistently? 
3.  Resistance training. Have you been following your weight training program and applying 
progressive resistance consistently, week by week? 
4.  Nutrition. Do you have a customized meal plan in writing and have you followed it every day to 
the best of your ability? 
When you rate your compliance to your nutrition program, be sure to rate yourself twice: once for 
compliance to your food quality and again for compliance to your food quantity. 
When most people think about compliance, they only think about whether they followed their 
allowed-foods list (food quality). They pat themselves on the back for eating so cleanly and say, ―I 
followed my plan!‖ But for fat loss, the real question is: How was your compliance to your calorie 
deficit (food quantity)? Too much healthy (a.k.a. ―clean‖) food is the cause of many fat-loss plateaus. 
You also should ask yourself whether it‘s possible you underestimated your calorie intake or 
overestimated your activity level. Almost everyone reports eating fewer calories than they really do; 
it‘s one of the most well-known facts in weight-loss research. 
The landmark study on this was done at St. Luke‘s‒Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York and 
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Steven W. Lichtman and his research team 
hypothesized that many overweight people do not lose weight because their calorie intake was 
substantially higher than what they reported. The subjects were chosen specifically because they had a 
claimed history of ―diet resistance.‖ They had made at least eight attempts at weight loss in the past, 
they believed they were eating less than 1,200 calories a day, and many of them thought they had a 
metabolism or thyroid problem. 
The results were a big surprise to the subjects but confirmed the hypothesis of the researchers: 
Under laboratory-controlled conditions, they found that the study participants underestimated their 
food intake by a whopping 47 percent and overestimated their physical activity by 51 percent! The 
authors concluded that ―failure to lose weight despite a self-reported low calorie intake can be 
explained by substantial misreporting of food intake and low physical activity.‖ 
Even health professionals are not immune to this error. In another study, a group of dieticians 
underreported their food intake by an average of 16 percent. They self-corrected when confronted with 
the discrepancy, but you would think that dieticians would be among the people most likely to report 
food intake most accurately. The major lesson here is to be sure you rule out the most common and 
obvious cause of plateaus before you make any other assumptions: You may simply be eating more 
than you thought you were. 
The plateau-breaking lesson that naturally follows is that if you‘ve been guesstimating food 
portions, it‘s time to get serious about your calorie and macronutrient numbers. Measure, count, and 
track your food intake. When you do it the first time, you may be shocked at how easy it is to 
underestimate your calories. But you‘ll be glad you did it because you can then self-correct and start 
making progress again. 

================================================================================
If you realize that compliance was your problem, don‘t beat yourself up; simply refocus and 
recommit to your original plan. Rewriting and rereading your goals will help. Map out your training 
and nutrition strategy for the next seven days in advance and schedule the workouts right in your daily 
planner with the rest of your appointments. Increase your accountability by sharing your goals with a 
friend. Then go back to work with renewed motivation and enthusiasm. 
If you were tracking carefully and you know your compliance was spot-on, then it‘s time to 
consider the other possible causes of your plateau—the biological ones. 
PHYSIOLOGICAL REASONS FOR PLATEAUS 
Your body doesn‘t like to change. Every system in your body is tightly regulated to maintain 
homeostasis. Blood sugar, body temperature, and acid-base balance are a few examples. When the 
delicate balance in your body is disturbed, your body sees that as a threat to your survival, so feedback 
mechanisms automatically kick in to bring you back to normal. Your weight is no different. You adapt 
hormonally and metabolically to dieting and weight loss. The more you restrict calories and the more 
weight you lose, the more your metabolism slows down. 
If all else is equal and you‘ve remained compliant to your original plan, a plateau means that your 
body has adapted. In Chapter 2, you learned the six strategies to avoid as much of this adaptation as 
possible. By avoiding starvation diets, you reduce the frequency and severity of adaptation and the 
frequency of plateaus. However, metabolic adaptation is unavoidable: It‘s what your body does 
naturally when you lose weight and restrict calories. 
This drop in metabolism is highly misunderstood. Most people don‘t realize that it occurs for two 
reasons. The first part of the metabolic slowdown is from the loss in total body weight. Smaller people 
burn fewer calories than larger people, so the more weight you lose and the lighter you get, the more 
your deficit shrinks, even at the same calorie intake. That‘s one reason why the more weight you lose, 
the harder it gets to continue losing weight. 
Here‘s an example. Kevin is a 40-year-old active male, 5 feet 8 inches tall and 235 pounds. If you 
run his numbers through the calorie formulas, you‘ll see his maintenance level is about 3,200 calories 
per day. With a 20 percent deficit, which is fairly conservative, he would want to eat 2,600 calories 
per day to lose weight. 
Suppose Kevin successfully loses 50 pounds and becomes a lean 185 pounder. But then he wants to 
knock off that last 10 pounds so he can be ―ripped.‖ Now that he weighs 185 pounds, if you run his 
calorie calculations again you see that the math equation has changed! 
Kevin is a smaller guy now, so he needs fewer calories. At 185 pounds, his maintenance level is 
now only 2,800 calories a day. He‘s burning 400 calories a day less than when he started! If he keeps 
eating the same way he did when he was a bigger guy, he will hardly lose any weight because he 
doesn‘t need that many calories to sustain his weight anymore. Suppose Kevin also forgets to account 
for a measly 200 calories per day—now his deficit is gone and his plateau has been fully explained. 
The second part of the metabolic slowdown is adaptive thermogenesis. This means that when you 
restrict calories and lose weight, your metabolism slows down even more than you‘d predict from the 
weight loss alone. It happens through a complex weight-regulating mechanism, involving numerous 
hormones and body systems becoming more efficient. 
It‘s similar to how the thermostat in your home turns on when the temperature drops. You have the 
temperature set at a nice, comfortable level, and when the temperature regulation system detects a 
drop below that set point, it automatically turns on the heat to bring the temperature back up. If your 
weight regulating system detects a change in body weight below its usual set point, the metabolic 

================================================================================
thermostat turns the calorie-burning hormones down and the hunger hormones up. Your body 
becomes more efficient, and burns fewer calories while simultaneously tricking you into eating more. 
With fewer calories out and more calories coming in, your calorie deficit shrinks, your fat loss 
slows down, and eventually you reach a plateau. Although the weight regulating mechanism that 
causes metabolism to slow down and hunger to go up is extremely complex, you should see by now 
that the explanation for a fat-loss plateau is very simple: If you were losing weight but your weight 
loss has stopped completely, you had a calorie deficit, but now you‘ve lost it. 
THREE TYPES OF PLATEAUS, THREE TYPES OF SOLUTIONS 
When you finally understand the true nature of fat-loss plateaus, the solution seems clear: To start 
burning fat again, you must reestablish your calorie deficit. You can do that by eating less or burning 
more, and I‘ll show you the progression variables you can use to do that in the last section of the 
chapter. 
Depending on how long you‘ve been dieting and training, and how severely, you can also use 
strategies designed to restimulate your metabolism and reverse the adaptive responses. This makes it 
easier to establish a significant calorie deficit or allow your body to recognize a deficit. 
Before you start training harder or dieting stricter, you should consider that the condition your body 
is in might affect the type of strategy you use to kick-start your progress. Sometimes you need to push 
harder; sometimes your body needs a rest before pushing harder again will have much effect. 
A dieted-down and depleted body doesn‘t respond the same way as a well-fed and well-rested body. 
Your metabolic, hormonal, and mental state are not the same. In fact, some of the strategies that work 
best in the early stages work the least in the late stages. Late-stage plateau-breaking strategies are 
often counterintuitive. Many people do the opposite of what they should and dig themselves into 
deeper metabolic holes. 
1. Early-stage plateau: Break it with harder work and progression. 
The early stage on the program is the first and second month. When you hit a plateau in the early 
stages, it usually means you need to apply some type of progression. More of the same will only get 
your more of the same. You need to challenge yourself. 
Many people underestimate how much effort it really takes to get lean. They‘ve been sold on rapid 
weight-loss diets and minimalist training programs, so their expectations get distorted. The truth is it 
takes dedication and hard work to get results, and even harder work to continue making progress. If 
the effort you‘re putting in isn‘t getting you the results you want, then quietly, and without 
complaining, accept that you may need to work longer, harder, more often, or all of the above. 
You can try to hone in on the one area likely to make the biggest difference, because you‘ve 
identified it‘s the area where you have the most room for improvement. Or you can completely smash 
a plateau by applying changes across all four areas: nutrition, cardio training, resistance training, and 
mental training. Remember the mental aspect. When you‘re stuck, you‘re most likely to slip there, yet 
it‘s the time you need proper focus and a positive attitude the most. 
Overall, the mandate is clear: Tighten the diet belt, train harder. Be meticulous. Weigh and measure 
your food and count your calories more diligently. Get stricter about everything. 
2. Mid-stage plateau: Break it with cycling methods. 
If your calorie intake has been in a deficit for a significant amount of time—two to three months—and 
your fat loss seems slower than it should be (on paper), you will continue applying progression in your 

================================================================================
training and tightening the belt anywhere you recognize your compliance has slipped. But you may 
also need to apply a new and different strategy. Your body is starting to adapt to the low calories and 
become more efficient at doing the workouts. Sometimes the best thing you can do is temporarily raise 
your calories in order to restimulate your fat-burning hormones. 
That doesn‘t mean pig out or go off the nutrition program. It‘s simply a way of giving your body a 
break from continuous deprivation. Eating more gives your metabolism a boost, resets regulatory 
hormones, and gives you a psychological break as well. For the most part, keep your food quality high 
and eat more of the same nutrient-dense foods. Here‘s how: 
One or two days a week, raise your calories—especially the carbs—up to maintenance instead of 
staying on low calories every day. 
This is known as the re-feeding or cycling method. I‘ve mentioned it before and you‘ll learn more 
about the specifics in the final chapter, where I show you a complete cycling plan, including how 
much more to eat, when to eat, and what to eat to make it work the best. Yes, this is counterintuitive. 
Do it anyway. You‘ll thank me. 
3. Late-stage plateau: Break it with rest and recovery. 
Training more and dieting harder are not always the best strategies. Sometimes when you‘re stuck in 
the mud, pushing on the gas pedal just spins your wheels and digs you into a deeper rut. 
If you‘ve been training hard, long, and often for months—three to four or more—your plateau could 
be related to overtraining or adaptation to high-volume exercise. Your body adapts to high-volume 
training in a similar way it does to calorie restriction: It becomes more efficient. If you suspect this is 
causing your stagnation, sometimes the best thing to do—at least temporarily—is cut back on your 
volume or go back to a minimalist routine. If you‘re seriously overtrained, you may need a short time 
off to let your body fully recover. 
If you‘ve been dieting hard for at least three to four months, you‘ve leaned out quite a bit, but 
you‘re struggling with the last of the stubborn fat, you might want to consider taking a diet break. This 
is the most counterintuitive of all the plateau-breaking strategies because a diet break means that 
you‘ll eat more by returning your calories to maintenance level for at least one full week. 
Although you might gain some weight, it‘s usually only a few pounds and it‘s mostly water and 
increased glycogen storage. You won‘t gain fat if you only return your calories to maintenance. The 
increase in calories shuts off the starvation alarm, stimulates your metabolism, and resets the fat-
burning and starvation hormones. You also get a psychological break from the diet as well, which 
makes it easier to stick with the program when you go back to it. 
When you return to your calorie deficit after a break, or to your training program after a rest, your 
body will respond again the way it did when you first started the program. So don‘t worry about losing 
ground by taking time for recovery. When you need a rest, take a rest. You‘ll probably hold steady. 
But even if you do take a step back, look at your break as one step back to prepare for two steps 
forward. When you get back to work with a fully recovered body, you‘ll be amazed how easily you‘ll 
blast beyond your old plateau, capture new ground, and reach a new personal best. 
ADAPTATION AND THE ART OF COAXING PROGRESS 
Your body will forever be adapting to everything you throw at it and you will always be working 
against your body‘s tendency to remain the same. Energy balance is dynamic; the amount of calories 
you need is constantly changing, and during weight loss and calorie restriction that amount is 

================================================================================
decreasing. To continue making progress and reduce the time spent on plateaus, the bottom line is that 
you must change your approach as your body changes. 
If you have a week with no progress and you keep doing the same thing, you‘ll keep getting the 
same results. Part of the art in body transformation is knowing what variables to change and when to 
change them. The more options you have, the better your chances of success, so let me show you 
some of your basic options. 
PROGRESSION VARIABLES TO BREAK FAT-LOSS PLATEAUS 
AND KEEP MAKING PROGRESS 
Here‘s the master checklist of the eight most important training and nutrition variables you can adjust 
each week to break plateaus and keep your progress coming. 
1. Eat less. 
The whole idea of Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is to eat more and burn more for a faster metabolism 
and better nutrition. Sometimes, however, there‘s no way around it: To break a fat-loss plateau, you 
must reduce your food intake. If you‘ve stopped losing body fat, it means you‘re no longer in a calorie 
deficit. 
Reducing food intake is the ideal choice for reestablishing the deficit if you‘ve only recently started 
the program or if you think you overestimated your initial calorie needs. However, if your calories are 
already low or you‘ve already cut them to break previous plateaus, cutting calories more can backfire. 
So cut calories when you have breathing room to do so, but always remember that there are two sides 
to the equation: You can eat less, burn more, or use a combination of both. 
2. Change your macronutrient ratios. 
Decreasing your carbs (increasing your protein ratio) can often help break a plateau, especially when 
you‘re already lean and you want to get leaner. This change in macronutrient ratios may give a slight 
metabolic or hormonal advantage over a high-carb diet, especially for endomorphs or carb-intolerant 
types who have problems with blood sugar and appetite control. A small change in macronutrients 
won‘t make or break your success, but when you have to cut calories, it makes sense to cut the carb 
calories first while keeping your lean protein, fibrous carb, and healthy fat intake stable. You‘ll learn 
more about the specifics of macronutrient manipulation and lower-carb diets in the final chapter. 
3. Improve your food quality. 
Breaking a plateau is mainly an issue of calorie quantity and reestablishing an energy deficit. 
However, when fat loss slows down, I believe it pays to be stricter about the quality of your food 
choices. Eat fewer processed foods and more natural foods. It‘s always better for your health, and it 
may help you with your deficit. The trick there is to increase nutrient density while controlling the 
calorie density. This is much easier to do with natural foods like vegetables and fish compared to man-
made foods like pastries or fast-food burgers. You could get away with eating low-quality, highly 
processed foods and still lose weight as long as you stayed in a calorie deficit, but when your calories 
are getting lower and lower, it only makes sense to get the highest nutrient density possible from every 
calorie you eat. 

================================================================================
4. Increase the duration of your cardio. 
On the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle program, most people average about 30 minutes of cardio 
training per session for fat loss. If this doesn‘t produce the desired results, you can increase your 
calorie burn by extending your duration incrementally five to ten minutes at a time. Measure the 
results of each increase on a weekly basis until you find the level where you break the plateau and 
start dropping fat at the rate you want. For most people, 30 to 45 minutes per session gives excellent 
results. You can go longer, but after 45 to 60 minutes you usually get a diminished rate of return 
compared to using other plateau-breaking strategies. 
5. Increase the frequency of your cardio. 
If you‘re already doing long workouts, continuing to increase your duration can become impractical. 
At this point, one option is to increase your frequency. A realistic starting point is a minimum of three 
days per week of cardio training. To break a plateau or increase the rate of fat loss, incrementally add 
one day per week until you reach six or seven days per week. Don‘t try to keep up daily cardio for 
months on end or use it as a crutch for poor nutrition. But used as a way to break a fat-loss plateau and 
reach peak condition, daily cardio can work wonders to get you lean superfast. It‘s not a coincidence 
that so many bodybuilders and fitness models do cardio every day before they step onstage or in front 
of the camera. 
Twice-a-day cardio is another advanced strategy some people might use for short periods to break a 
plateau or to get extremely lean. This is an extreme strategy that‘s neither mandatory nor practical for 
most people who aren‘t full-time athletes. But many bodybuilders and figure athletes use double 
cardio before competitions and swear it‘s the one thing that gets them through any plateau and, more 
importantly, sheds the last few pounds of stubborn fat. Two-a-day cardio is also a strategy you might 
use when there‘s a deadline and you need maximum fat loss in a short period of time. 
High-volume cardio done for prolonged periods while in an aggressive calorie deficit can actually 
increase metabolic adaptation, so this strategy could backfire if you don‘t use it with caution. If you 
ever advance to double cardio, don‘t overdo the duration or intensity at every workout and don‘t 
continue with double cardio sessions for long. This is a peaking or plateau-breaking strategy, not 
something you do year-round. 
6. Increase the intensity of your cardio. 
The most time-efficient way to break a plateau is to increase the intensity of the cardio you‘re already 
doing. This simply means work harder! Push yourself to burn more calories in the same time you were 
already spending. Of course, you can increase intensity only so much because eventually you 
approach the anaerobic threshold. That‘s when you push harder and start to lose your breath and have 
to slow down or stop to recover the oxygen debt before you can continue. But most people who have 
been doing low or moderate intensity workouts have plenty of room to boost the intensity level. Many 
people forget that that intensity is not a switch with two settings, high or low; it‘s a dial with low, 
medium, high, and everything in between. Smart physique athletes turn up the dial on intensity as one 
of the progression variables to accelerate fat loss or break plateaus. This applies to both steady-state 
and interval training. 
7. Add high intensity interval training or sprint work into your cardio program. 
As you learned in Chapter 15, interval training can give you a very high calorie burn in a short period 
of time. As little as 20 to 25 minutes of intervals (counting the warm-up and cooldown) can burn 

================================================================================
enough calories for some serious fat loss. Interval training also increases your metabolic rate so you 
keep burning calories after the workout is over. The higher the intensity, the higher the ―afterburn‖ 
effect. Intense interval training is usually not recommended for beginners, but after several weeks of 
building up a fitness base, introducing more intense training is the next step. If you‘ve hit a plateau, 
that‘s a perfect time to implement it. 
8. Change the type of cardio. 
If you have a favorite type of cardio you really enjoy, by all means, stay with it, and when you‘re 
getting good results, never change for the sake of change. When your progress is starting to flatline, 
however, a change alone can restimulate your progress and your motivation. 
For example, if you‘ve been walking, change the type of exercise to stair-climber, elliptical 
machine, or stationary bicycle. If you‘ve been using the elliptical machine, try an intense kickboxing 
or boot camp class. Try anything your body isn‘t used to. Changing your workouts is also a great way 
to prevent boredom and recharge your enthusiasm while avoiding repetitive overuse injuries. 
FAT-LOSS PLATEAUS VERSUS MUSCLE-BUILDING PLATEAUS 
Keep in mind that most of this information has been directed at breaking a fat-loss plateau. But as you 
learned in the section on weight training, your body adapts not only to diets but to all kinds of training 
as well. In a matter of weeks or months, your muscles will adapt to every resistance training program 
you follow. Once your body has adapted, continuing with the same training program doesn‘t always 
produce the same results. There‘s a popular saying among trainers and strength coaches: Everything 
works, but nothing works for long. 
If your goals currently include gaining muscle or if they change to gaining muscle in the future, 
progress plateaus are going to happen during that endeavor as well. In some ways, continuing to gain 
lean muscle for months on end after the beginner gains have ended can be more challenging than 
keeping the fat loss coming. 
It goes beyond the scope of this book to go into detail about breaking muscle-building plateaus, but 
in Chapters 16 and 17 you already got the basic tools you need. All you have to do is follow the 
resistance-training success principles, especially progressive overload, variation, and periodization, 
and you‘ll continue making great progress in strength and lean muscle. 
Keep in mind especially that beginners can make progress on the same routine longer. The more 
advanced you become, the more quickly your body adapts and the more often you should change. 
Changing programs regularly not only outsmarts your body‘s adaptive mechanisms, it also beats 
boredom and keeps your enthusiasm high, and those factors alone can help you keep the results 
coming. 
THE FOOLPROOF SECRET TO BREAKING ANY PLATEAU 
Progress plateaus are rarely caused by some genetic anomaly or hormonal defect. The simplest 
explanation is almost always the correct one: If your fat loss has stopped, your body has adapted and 
you‘re no longer in a calorie deficit. The questions to ask are: What happened to your calorie deficit 
and what is the best strategy to use in your situation to get progress rolling again? 
To stay motivated, it‘s important to keep reminding yourself that when you hit a plateau, it‘s not a 
bad thing; it‘s a normal thing. It‘s simply your body‘s signal that it has adapted to the stresses you‘ve 
been imposing on it, and you need to do something different and more challenging for positive 

================================================================================
adaptations to continue. Now you have an entire arsenal of techniques you can use to push through to 
the next level of progress. 
Combine the information in this chapter with what you learned in Chapter 5 about using feedback 
loops and tracking progress, and you have a foolproof success system to break any plateau. Measure 
everything you want to improve, use the progress chart, get into a weekly feedback loop, hold yourself 
accountable for results, and let your results dictate your next move. If you get stuck, choose a strategy 
to reestablish your deficit, restimulate your metabolism or restart your progress, go back to work for 
another seven days, and measure your results again. If it worked, keep it up. If it didn‘t work, repeat 
this process until you succeed. 
Coming up next, you‘re going to read about a strategy that you can use not only to break tough 
plateaus: It‘s also a secret weapon to accelerate your fat loss. You can use it to reach the most 
challenging of goals, such as peaking for a competition, getting in photo-shoot shape, or getting lean 
enough to see six-pack abs. It‘s the technique that bodybuilders, figure athletes, and fitness models 
depend on more than any other, and you can use it to reach your goals too. Learn how in the final 
chapter. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 19 
How to Accelerate Your Fat Loss 
Basically, I manipulate my carbohydrate intake to turn my body into a fat burning machine!

THE BURN THE FAT, FEED THE MUSCLE APPROACH TO 
ULTIMATE LEANNESS 

================================================================================
You‘ve learned the fundamentals, you‘ve put all the elements into action, and you‘re getting results. 
But what if you want results faster? What if you want to reach an extraordinary level of leanness? 
What if you want to break through a tough plateau, burn off the final ten pounds of stubborn fat, 
uncover a set of six-pack abs, or get in peak condition for a contest or photo shoot? You‘ll learn how 
to do all these things in this final chapter. 
These are the advanced techniques for getting ripped that physique athletes and fitness models use. 
They‘re also the same techniques I‘ve used to hit low-single-digit body fat for more than two dozen 
bodybuilding competitions. These are the methods that unlock the final level of leanness. Think of 
them as your ―sprint to the finish line.‖ It all revolves around a few unique twists on the old low-carb 
diet. 
Most low-carb diets are, by definition, dogmatic. Carbs are the bad foods, and you‘re only allowed 
to eat so many grams, period. Not so with this program. This new approach is superior because it‘s 
carb customized for your goals and preferences. In Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, using carb 
restriction at all is optional. You may not want to or need to restrict carbs. However, to accelerate fat 
loss, the flexibility to easily apply these carb manipulation techniques is built right into the program. 
WHEN TO USE A LOW-CARB DIET 
Most people have no trouble getting results without resorting to major carb restriction. But there‘s 
always a subset of people who struggle more than others and are frustrated with their lack of results 
despite honest efforts. Broadly, we call them endomorphs. These people sometimes eat fewer carbs to 
begin with and cut them even more to really get fat loss cranking. Others get results steadily for weeks 
or even months while eating generous amounts of carbs, but then hit a plateau or find themselves 
falling behind schedule for an important deadline. A reduced-carb diet with more healthy fat and 
protein can be an important part of the solution. 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is not, however, a low-carb diet by default. In fact, when I talk about 
the low-carb approach, I intentionally use the word ―diet‖ because when carbs are cut substantially I 
consider it a short-term adjustment. I don‘t see very-low-carb eating as a lifestyle for most people. A 
more balanced macronutrient split that doesn‘t severely restrict food groups, combined with plenty of 
exercise, is the real ideal lifestyle plan. 
Why and when would you reduce carbs? Here are three situations where low-carb dieting is most 
appropriate: 
1. Accelerating fat loss 
You‘re making progress, but it‘s too slow. Maybe your goal was 2 pounds of fat loss per week and 
you‘re losing only 1. Or perhaps you‘d be satisfied with a pound a week, but it‘s more like a pound a 
month. You think to yourself, ―I‘m patient, but this is ridiculous. There has to be a way to get results 
faster without spending more hours in the gym.‖ 
2. Breaking a plateau 
Even if you drop fat slowly and sensibly, it‘s natural for your fat loss to eventually slow down as you 
get leaner and leaner—that is, unless you have some plateau-breaking strategies in your fat burning 
tool kit. Pulling back on the carbs while keeping the protein high is as close to a sure thing as you‘ll 
find. Using a cyclical low-carb diet (which you‘ll also learn about in this chapter) is even better 
because it can boost a sluggish metabolism or help prevent plateaus before they happen. 

================================================================================
3. Peaking for bodybuilding, physique, fitness, figure, or transformation contests 
Reduced-carb diets are controversial in some corners of the fitness world, but most physique athletes 
use them. Some restrict aggressively, others only moderately, but when it comes time to get ultra-lean 
for a competition or photo shoot, almost all of them follow a high-protein diet with at least some 
degree of carb restriction. I find this commonality striking, and since bodybuilders are the leanest 
muscular athletes in the world, you might want to take notice too. 
HOW DOES REDUCING CARBS INCREASE FAT LOSS? 
Any diet that puts you in a deficit can cause weight loss, so you could cut calories across the board 
and you‘ll lose weight. But there are several reasons why cutting carb calories specifically can help 
with advanced fat-loss goals. If you jump into a low-carb diet without understanding why you‘re 
doing it and how it works, you‘re likely to fall down a rabbit hole of carbophobia and unnecessary 
food avoidance. A unique trait of physique athletes is that they‘re not afraid of carbs; they learn how 
to manipulate carbs, eating more at times and less at other times. Here are the reasons why they (and 
you) might reduce them: 
1. Low-carb, high-protein diets are highly thermic. 
Protein has the highest thermic effect of any food, up to 30 percent. For example, if you eat 100 
calories of chicken breast, 30 of those calories are burned off just to digest and utilize it. The net 
caloric value is only 70 calories. Ironically, it‘s high protein that gives you the metabolic advantage, 
not the low carbs, so it may be more accurate to say that high-protein, low-carb diets help accelerate 
fat loss rather than credit the low carbs alone. Because of the high thermic effect, protein is less likely 
to be converted to fat than any other macronutrient. 
2. Low-carb diets help control calories, reduce hunger, and increase satiety. 
Protein is the most satiating of all the macronutrients. Dietary fat makes food taste richer, so it has a 
psychologically satisfying effect, but it doesn‘t physiologically quell hunger the way protein does. 
Protein makes you feel fuller and decreases hunger hormonally. High-protein meals increase 
glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), a hormone that makes you feel fuller, and the hormone PYY, which 
reduces appetite. 
3. Low-carb diets help control insulin. 
When you reduce carbs, you reduce insulin output. Since high insulin levels prevent stored fat from 
being released, controlling insulin with carb restriction may help assist fat loss, especially the last few 
pounds of stubborn fat. Certain types of stubborn fat deposits are highly sensitive to the effects of 
insulin and more resistant to releasing stored fatty acids. When insulin is lower, stubborn fat is more 
easily released into circulation and then burned for energy. 
4. Low-carb, high-protein diets help reduce water retention. 
A high-protein, low-carb diet tends to decrease water retention. This gives a more defined look to your 
muscles. Bloating and puffiness from water retention is only temporary and shouldn‘t be confused 
with real changes in body composition. However, improved muscle definition is one more reason 
physique athletes say they prefer this type of diet for their final peaking phase. 

================================================================================
DISADVANTAGES OF THE LOW-CARB DIET 
Before you consider cutting carbs or trying a competition diet, it‘s important to understand the 
downsides and why we don‘t consider it a lifestyle but a short-term strategy to reach a specific goal. 
This section lists eight of them, which can help you make an informed decision about whether carb 
restriction is right for you. 
1. Low-carb diets are more difficult to stay on. 
Low-carb diets are more restrictive and harder to follow. On the most extreme type of low-carb diet, 
you‘re only allowed to eat protein (or protein and fat) with limited amounts of leafy greens and 
nonstarchy vegetables. I‘m sure almost anyone can grin and bear that for a while, but it requires 
tremendous restraint and may set you up for cravings and binges. 
2. Low-carb diets have a high relapse rate. 
If you lose weight quickly on a strict low-carb diet, the odds of relapse and weight regain are usually 
higher. It doesn‘t just happen to weight-loss dieters. I‘ve seen seasoned bodybuilders gain 20 pounds 
the week after a contest because they went on a sugar binge after a four-month diet of protein, salad, 
and veggies. Transitioning off a low-carb diet must be planned carefully and executed gradually, 
preferably reintroducing the carbs a little at a time with each passing week. It takes self-control and 
discipline to pull it off. 
3. Low-carb diets may be unbalanced and lack essential nutrients. 
A balanced nutrition program, by definition, has a nice mix between proteins, carbs, and fats, and 
includes a wide variety of foods. Any diet that requires you to eat mostly one food or to remove or 
severely restrict an entire food group is not balanced. That makes it more likely to be missing 
important nutrients. Some low-carb diets are so strict that fruit is off-limits and even vegetables are 
kept to a minimum. This can leave you short on fiber and important vitamins and minerals. 
4. Low-carb diets may be unhealthy. 
Low-carb diets that are mostly protein almost guarantee rapid weight loss, but without adequate fiber 
and micronutrient intake, a low-carb diet can be unhealthy, especially if you follow it for a long time. 
Some low-carb (ketogenic) diets are actually high in fat, not high in protein. This could also be 
unhealthy if the types of fat aren‘t well balanced or if the fat is so high it pushes out other nutrients. 
It‘s also never smart to eat large amounts of processed low-carb foods. 
5. Low-carb diets can kill your energy levels. 
A complaint from many low-carb dieters is the drop in energy and training performance. That‘s why 
most athletes eat more carbs. Many low-carb dieters notice there‘s an adaptation phase where they 
admit the initial weeks on the diet are miserable, but they say it gets easier as the body gets used to it. 
However, most people who are serious about their training agree that maintaining energy and workout 
intensity on low carbs is an ongoing challenge. 
6. Low-carb diets can produce deceiving weight-loss results. 

================================================================================
Much of the weight loss in the initial phase of a low-carb diet comes from water and glycogen 
depletion. It‘s not uncommon to see four to eight pounds a week drop off in the first two weeks in 
people who start out heavy. But when you judge your results by body composition instead of body 
weight, you‘ll see the results are deceiving. For example, if one pound is fat, one pound is muscle, and 
three pounds are water, a five-pound weight loss isn‘t so impressive anymore. 
7. Low-carb diets affect your mental state. 
Low-carb diets are known for producing ―brain fog.‖ When you deprive yourself of carbs, it‘s not 
uncommon to become moody, irritable, and an all-around grouchy S.O.B. Ask anyone who has ever 
done a strict low-carb diet (or anyone who has lived with a low-carb dieter), and they‘ll tell you. The 
stories (and jokes) about grumpy low-carb dieters and the Jekyll-and-Hyde personality change are 
numerous—even legendary! 
8. Low-carb diets may increase the risk of muscle loss. 
Preventing muscle loss is a challenge on any calorie-restricted diet, but when you restrict carbs, your 
body can easily use protein for energy through a process called gluconeogenesis. More often than not, 
I‘ve seen all kinds of low-carb diets increase the risk of muscle loss, especially if protein isn‘t high 
enough, if calories are too low, and if the dieter isn‘t weight training. 
THE FOUR SECRETS OF MAKING LOW-CARB DIETS MORE 
EFFECTIVE AND EASIER TO FOLLOW 
Reading the list of potential drawbacks is enough to make some people steer clear of low-carb diets 
and stick with their baseline nutrition plans. But there are ways to get the benefits of low carbing 
without all the side effects. These include: 
1.  Progressive carb reductions. Decrease your carbs slowly, only if you need to, based on your 
weekly results. 
2.  Moderate carb restriction. Cut some carbs but don‘t remove them completely. 
3.  Carb targeting. Eat carbs in the pre- and postworkout meals on training days. 
4.  Carb cycling. Cycle the carbs instead of staying on low carbs all the time. 
For people who are training, these methods are vastly superior to the old style of low-carb diets 
found in most popular diet programs. When you put them together, you can achieve incredibly low 
body-fat levels, develop super muscle definition, and maintain all your hard-earned muscle without 
making your life miserable. 
PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION OF CARBS 
Most popular weight-loss programs start you with the strictest version of their diet right from day one. 
Typically this means severe restrictions on carbohydrates. A 30- to 70-gram-per-day limit is common. 
After you‘ve lost the weight, you‘re allowed to gradually ―loosen it up,‖ putting some carbs back in. 
Some of these programs call the initial phase ―induction,‖ while others call it a ―quick start.‖ 

================================================================================
The quick loss of scale weight can be motivating and makes the program appear more effective, but 
essentially they‘ve put you on a crash diet. Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle does it the other way 
around. We emulate the bodybuilder‘s method, in which you start with a normal (higher) carb intake 
(similar to a bodybuilder‘s off-season eating plan) and gradually ―tighten it up‖ by reducing calories 
and carbs as your weekly results dictate and you get closer to peak condition (similar to a 
bodybuilder‘s precontest diet). 
Why should you gradually reduce carbs and calories? One reason is that Burn the Fat, Feed the 
Muscle is an athlete‘s style of eating, so it‘s a foregone conclusion that you‘ll be training hard. This 
alone calls for a higher carb intake than a sedentary person. The sudden removal of carbs that you‘re 
accustomed to using for fuel can wreak havoc on your training intensity. 
The second reason is that if you play all your cards on day one and you hit a plateau later, what 
then? There‘s nowhere to go: Your carbs and calories are already slashed to a minimum. The smarter 
approach is to keep an ace in the hole. Why not eat the most carbs you can while still losing body fat? 
The third reason to gradually reduce carbs is: Why suffer unnecessarily? The last few pounds are 
always hardest to get rid of because of how your body adapts as you lose weight. Your initial weight 
loss should always be the easiest, so making the diet too strict from day one doesn‘t make sense. I 
know people who made one or two changes—little things like cutting out soda and reducing visits to 
fast-food restaurants—and followed a simple workout program. These changes got them 80 percent of 
the way to their goal. No major carb cutting, no forbidden foods, nothing crazy at all—just training, a 
calorie deficit, and healthier choices. Only later, for the final push toward six-pack abs, did they get 
stricter. 
If you‘re having a hard time losing even the first few pounds, there‘s something seriously wrong 
with your nutrition strategy. Crash diets are the last thing you need; you must focus on fundamentals. 
It‘s the final phases of fat loss—achieving goals like single-digit body fat or six-pack abs—that takes 
serious tightening of the diet belt. If you must cut more calories somewhere, cutting carbs is one of the 
best ways to tighten up. 
MODERATE CARB RESTRICTION: THE ACCELERATED FAT-
LOSS DIET 
Some studies have shown that replacing just one serving of carbs with one serving of lean protein per 
day is enough to make a difference. A moderate 10 percent to 15 percent reduction in carbs with a 
corresponding increase in protein (and/or good fats) can sometimes work wonders, especially for 
endomorphs. After this initial drop in carbs, the shift in macronutrient ratios might look something 
like this: 
THE MODERATE-CARB, HIGH-PROTEIN ACCELERATED FAT-LOSS DIET 
40 percent carbohydrates 
40 percent protein 
20 percent fat 
Forty percent carbs is not a low-carb diet by many people‘s standards; it‘s considered moderate 
carb. But it‘s lower in carbs than the baseline and higher in protein. This usually works out to about 
140 to 180 grams of carbs per day for women and 200 to 250 grams per day for men, although the 
grams of each may vary based on a person‘s size and activity. 
In some cases, people with serious fat-loss goals, such as competing or doing photo shoots, might 
consider advancing to yet another level and decreasing carbs to as low as 25 percent to 30 percent of 

================================================================================
total calories. For the average male, a competition diet is usually about 150 to 200 grams of carbs per 
day. For the average female, carb intake is usually around 100 to 130 grams per day. 
Here the diet is tightened up to the strictest level. This is the final progression, because in Burn the 
Fat, Feed the Muscle we never cut carbs completely. 
THE LOW-CARB, VERY HIGH-PROTEIN ―COMPETITION DIET‖ 
25 percent to 30 percent carbohydrates 
45 percent to 50 percent protein 
20 percent to 25 percent fat 
It‘s not mandatory to progress to this final phase. This is a very strict diet consisting mostly of lean 
protein and fibrous vegetables with only limited starchy carbs. It‘s not for everyone and it‘s not a 
prescription. It‘s simply the way many physique champions prep for fitness or bodybuilding contests, 
which is why it‘s called a competition or peaking diet. 
Peaking diets, because they‘re restrictive, aren‘t used longer than the contest or photo-shoot prep 
period, which typically lasts about 12 weeks. The actual duration of a contest prep phase depends on 
an athlete‘s starting body fat level. If you‘re already lean, it might take you only 6 to 8 weeks to peak. 
If your body fat is high, it might take you 14 to 16 weeks to peak. Afterward, athletes gradually shift 
back to a more balanced nutrition plan with more carbs and less protein for the maintenance or 
muscle-building phase. 
YOUR DAILY CARB INTAKE: HOW LOW IS TOO LOW? 
Some low-carb diet advocates argue that we don‘t need carbs at all. Technically speaking, they‘re 
right. The textbook definition of ―essential‖ refers to whether your body can manufacture a nutrient on 
its own or must obtain it from food. There are essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, essential 
vitamins, and essential minerals, but there are no essential carbs. 
If you have all the essentials, plus adequate energy, you could survive and even stay healthy on 
protein and fat with near-zero carbs. The question is: Do you merely want to ―survive‖? You can 
survive for weeks without food, but that doesn‘t mean it‘s a good idea to eat nothing for weeks on end. 
You can lose weight on a 100 percent Twinkie diet, provided your calories are in a deficit every day. 
That doesn‘t mean it‘s a good idea to eat nothing but Twinkies. 
Just because you can survive on protein and fat doesn‘t mean that‘s the best way to do it, especially 
if you‘re athletic. If you want peak performance, a muscular body, and a lifestyle you can enjoy, 
without long lists of forbidden foods, then you need carbs. It‘s simply a matter of finding the right 
amount for you. 
When it comes to cutting carbs, there‘s a point of diminishing returns. This point is not the same for 
everyone, and it takes some experimenting to find yours. When you‘re testing different carb levels, 
pay attention to how you feel physically and mentally, in and out of the gym; your experiments can 
help you fine-tune your intake. You‘ll know it when you reach your ―critical level,‖ because once 
you‘ve dropped your carbs too much, the side effects I mentioned earlier begin to rear their ugly 
heads. 
Extreme carb cuts may also have downsides that don‘t occur with moderate carb cuts. For example, 
cutting carbs too low can reduce thyroid levels. One study found that active thyroid levels fall when 
carbs drop below 120 grams per day. Studies also show that the antistarvation hormone leptin falls 
with both reduced calories and reduced body fat levels. It‘s an increase in carbs that restores leptin to 
normal levels and helps reduce symptoms of the starvation response. 

================================================================================
Coincidentally, the dietary reference intake (DRI) for carbs is 130 grams per day. All this data gives 
us some pretty good reasons to suggest approximately 120 to 130 grams per day as a sensible low end 
for carb intake for anyone active and in training. This corresponds closely to our recommendation of 
no less than 25 percent to 30 percent of total calories from carbs. 
Your personal response may vary. Some people tolerate low carbs better than others. Women, who 
have lower energy needs, can often go a little lower (100 grams or so) on the stricter competition diets. 
But most athletes will tell you that very low-carb diets are a real drag on their energy, performance, 
and mood. 
CARB TARGETING: THE NUTRIENT-TIMING TECHNIQUE FOR 
BETTER BODY COMPOSITION AND PEAK PERFORMANCE 
In the past, a big deal was made out of the time of day you eat, especially carbs. I‘ve known thousands 
of people over the years who said they got leaner by eating fewer starchy carbs at night (carb 
tapering). However, advancing research on nutrient timing suggests putting more attention on when 
you eat relative to when you train. I‘ve almost always trained in the morning or early afternoon, which 
is probably why I thrived on more food early in the day and less food later. 
There‘s no shortage of theories or opinions about the best time of day to work out or eat your meals. 
But the primary objective of nutrient timing that most experts agree on is to provide more fuel and 
nutrients when you need them the most. Earmarking some of your daily carb calories for around your 
workouts when you need them for energy, recovery, and growth is known as carb targeting. 
One of the best places for a high-carb-plus-protein meal is right after intense weight training. If you 
have enough carbs to work with, you can use the bracketing method and put carbs in your preworkout 
meal as well. This helps provide fuel and nutrients to improve your performance during your workout 
and recovery after. It can help improve body composition as well, as nutrients are partitioned into 
muscle for growth and glycogen repletion instead of into fat stores. 
BURN THE FAT, FEED THE MUSCLE ACCELERATED FAT-LOSS 
TEMPLATES 
The two core ingredients of the accelerated fat-loss meal are a lean protein and fibrous carb. The 
biggest difference between this and the baseline plan is that you‘ll be eating fewer starchy carbs. As 
your progress dictates, in some meals, you might remove the starchy carbs completely. 
If you ate nothing but lean protein and fibrous carbs at all of your meals, you‘d see the fat fall off, 
even if you didn‘t count calories or macros, because it‘s almost impossible to overeat lean proteins 
and fibrous carbs. Don‘t drop all your starchy carbs, though, because you need some to support your 
training energy and recovery. In fact, even when you drop your starches to a moderate level, you may 
need to increase the lean protein and healthy fat portions to prevent your calories from dropping too 
low. 
Here‘s what the meal template looks like: 
Step 1: Choose a lean protein for every meal. 
Step 2: Choose a fibrous carb for every meal. 
Step 3: Add in a small portion of starchy carbs or remove completely. 

================================================================================
Step 4: Add healthy fats as needed to reach your daily macronutrient goal. 
A typical daily meal plan template looks like this: 
Meal 1 
Time: 
Lean protein 
Fibrous carb (or fruit) 
Starchy carb (full serving) 
Meal 2 
Time: 
Lean protein 
Fibrous carb 
Starchy carb (full serving) 
Meal 3 
Time: 
Lean protein 
Fibrous carb 
Starchy carb (small serving or none) 
Meal 4 
Time: 
Lean protein 
Fibrous carb 
Meal 5 
Time: 
Lean protein 
Fibrous carb

TIPS FOR ACCELERATING FAT LOSS WITH REDUCED-CARB 
MEAL PLANS 
1.  Eliminate refined carbs. Reduce starchy carbs and grains. Eat more fibrous carbs and leafy 
greens. 
2.  You may use nonfat and low-fat dairy products, but emphasize lean meats, fish, eggs, and 
fibrous carbs first. Many physique athletes prefer to remove dairy products on competition 
diets. 

================================================================================
3.  Initially set macronutrient ratios at approximately 40 percent carbs, 40 percent protein, 
and 20 percent fat, give or take 5 percent. If you reach a fat-loss plateau or want to accelerate 
fat loss, you can reduce starchy carb calories more (to about 25 percent to 30 percent of total 
calories). That leaves mostly fibrous carbs and lean proteins with small amounts of healthy fats. 
Starchy carbs will be very low, but not removed completely. 
4.  Use the nutrient-timing method on weight training days, saving most of your carbs for 
around your workouts. If you train early in the day, front-load your carbs early. If you train 
later in the day, save most of your starchy carbs for your evening postworkout meal. On 
nontraining days, place your starchy carbs wherever you want them. I prefer having them for 
breakfast and then eating fibrous carbs and protein the rest of the day (carb tapering). 
5.  Always include at least one or two servings per day of healthy fats. When you cut your carbs 
significantly, some people feel fuller and more energetic by compensating with a slight increase 
in fat. If calories get too low, you can increase healthy fats (along with increased protein). 
6.  Use this plan for maximum fat loss or contest dieting, not long-term maintenance. After you 
reach your goal, gradually reintroduce more calories from starchy carbs and shift back to 
baseline carb levels. Introduce 100 to 200 more carb calories per week and measure results 
before increasing again. 
OUTSMART YOUR METABOLISM WITH CYCLICAL DIETING 
Here‘s the great catch-22 of all diets: If you want to burn fat, you must reduce your calories. But 
dropping your calories, especially your carb calories, can decrease your metabolism, increase your 
appetite, and trigger all kinds of adaptations that make it harder to keep getting leaner. It‘s also tough 
to follow restrictive diets. The good news is there‘s a solution. By adding one simple twist to the old 
low-carb diet, you can get all the low-carb benefits while minimizing the side effects. 
Typical diets have you cut calories and keep them at the same low level. But what if you didn‘t stay 
on low calories all the time? What if you dropped your calories for a short while, then increased them 
again at regular intervals? Every time you take a higher-calorie day, you boost your metabolism, 
satisfy your hunger, and help avoid the starvation response. This is cyclical dieting, also known as 
nonlinear dieting or zigzag dieting. It‘s an incredibly effective way to improve your body composition, 
increase compliance, avoid diet monotony, and break plateaus—or even avoid them completely. 
Many dieters have been advised to apply this concept by having a ―cheat day.‖ Once a week they 
eat anything and everything for a full day—cheesecake, pizza, doughnuts, anything goes—hoping to 
get the benefits I just mentioned. Although the full cheat day works for some people after an entire 
week of depletion, I‘ve seen it fail more often than not. The reason it backfires is because ―free-for-
all‖ cheat days too often turn into uncontrolled binge days that erase the hard work you did the week 
before. There‘s a better way. 
CARB CYCLING: SECRET WEAPON OF THE LEANEST PEOPLE IN 
THE WORLD 
The most effective way to do a cyclical diet is with a special variation on low carbing known as carb 
cycling. Carb cycling involves rotating lower-carb days and higher-carb days instead of keeping carbs 
low all the time. 

================================================================================
On the low days, follow your high-protein, low-carb ratios with a moderate or aggressive calorie 
deficit. You‘ll eat mostly lean protein and fibrous carbs with only small amounts of starchy carbs. 
Think of these as maximum fat-burning days. On the high days, you‘ll add calories, mostly from 
starchy carbs, until you hit maintenance level or slightly higher. High days are also known as ―re-
feeds.‖ Think of these as anabolic rebuilding and replenishing days. 
The benefits are numerous. More than any other macronutrient, carbs restimulate your metabolism-
regulating hormones. Your depleted glycogen levels are restored, your muscles fill out, your skin gets 
tighter, you feel a surge of energy, and you get a good pump in the gym again. The influx of carbs 
even has an anabolic effect that helps you retain lean body mass far better than a linear low-carb diet. 
On top of all this, you don‘t need to fear the carbs being stored as fat because carb-depleted muscles 
soak up carbs into glycogen like a dry sponge. 
The re-feed day is also a psychological trick that makes your plan easier to stick with. On the lower-
calorie, lower-carb days, you might be hungry and craving carbs, but if you‘re carb cycling, you can 
say to yourself, ―I can wait. There‘s another high-carb day coming soon.‖ (Compare this to ―I can 
never eat pasta again.‖) 
When to Use Carb Cycling 
Carb cycling is usually considered an advanced technique. It‘s the ace you pull out of your sleeve in 
the later phases. If you‘re a beginner, establish your basic healthy eating habits first. If you want to try 
carb cycling in the early phase of a fat-loss program, you can, but your body won‘t need the high days 
as often. The re-feeds are more important when your body is dieted down. 
Your starting body fat level is also a factor. The higher your body fat, the less necessary it is to re-
feed. When your body fat is high, you have less risk of muscle loss or metabolic slowdown. When 
you‘re leaner and have less energy in body fat storage (toward the end of a diet phase), the risk is 
higher. Re-feed days help prevent these problems. 
There are no hard-and-fast rules on re-feeding frequency except that for fat loss there must be more 
deficit days than re-feed days or you won‘t establish enough of a weekly deficit. A full re-feed day is 
also essential because, while a single high-carb meal may be psychologically satisfying, it‘s not 
enough to trigger all the physiological benefits. 
My suggestions: If you‘re a beginner or your body fat is on the high side (men 20 percent and up; 
women 25 percent and up), a re-feed is optional, or take one re-feed day every 7 to 14 days as you see 
fit to give you a break from continuous calorie restriction and to restore some physical and mental 
energy. 
For anyone in the lean or better category (men under 12 percent; women under 18 percent), re-feed 
at least once per week. Twice a week is probably ideal for contest prep or the lean (dieted-down) 
physique athlete. Among Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle followers, the most popular carb cycling 
method for getting super-lean is three days low followed by one day high (3:1 carb cycling). 
What Kind of Carbs to Eat When Carb Cycling 
You eat mostly the same types of carbs on your high-carb days as you normally would on this 
program; you simply eat more of them. Low-carb days emphasize fibrous carbs like nonstarchy 
vegetables, salads, and leafy greens. Because the amount of calories you need to add can be 
significant, the high-carb days emphasize starchy carbs like oatmeal, potatoes, yams, and brown rice. 
On high-carb days, you can also be more liberal with starchy carbs like pastas, cereals, and breads, 
preferably the whole grain varieties. These are the slightly processed starches so they may have more 

================================================================================
calorie density and less nutrient density than the natural carbs, but a re-feed day is an ideal day to 
include them if you choose. 
For some dieters, knowing they can have a carb-rich meal like a plate of pasta once or twice a week 
makes sticking to the program infinitely easier. Just remember that this is a ―controlled re-feed,‖ not 
an all-you-can-eat cheat day. 
How Many Carbs to Eat When Carb Cycling 
It‘s not possible to give one carb cycling schedule with calorie and carb amounts that apply to 
everyone. You have to customize. But let me show you a typical example for an average man with a 
2,800-calorie-per-day maintenance level and an average woman with a 2,100-calorie-per-day 
maintenance level. 
On low days, most people drop their carbs all the way down to the low-carb, very-high-protein 
ratios. Calories are set at an aggressive deficit, around 30 percent below maintenance; that‘s around 
1,500 for women and 2,000 for men, on average. On the high days, you increase your calories all the 
way back up to maintenance, which is about 2,100 for women and 2,800 for men. The easiest way to 
set up a carb cycling diet is to simply add more carbs on the high day and change nothing else. 
Don‘t worry too much about the percentages; the main thing to remember is this: On high days, 
―just add carbs.‖ But for all my number-crunching readers, it looks like this: For women, it usually 
works out to about 100 to 130 grams of carbs on low days and about 200 to 275 grams of carbs on 
high days. For men, it‘s typically 150 to 200 grams of carbs on low days and 300 to 400 grams on 
high days.

What’s the Most Effective Way to Carb Cycle? 
The carb cycling theory is based on sound psychology and physiology. However, there are no studies 
directly confirming what kind of carb cycling schedule is best. Almost all the information we have on 
carb cycling is based on personal experience from the bodybuilding, physique athlete, and fitness 
model community. 
I‘ve seen all kinds of complicated carb cycling schemes, including diets with low, medium, and 
high days, with carb amounts based on training volume and with lists of specific carbs that must be 
eaten at specific times on particular days. A popular method is to synchronize your high-carb day with 
your days of most intense weight training. There‘s probably merit to all these strategies, especially the 
last one, but I‘ve always found that the more complex you make it, the more confused you get. 
Simpler is better. 
Here‘s the big idea to let sink in: On your low-carb days, follow a strict calorie deficit, high protein, 
and low carbs (mostly fibrous carbs like salad greens and fibrous vegetables), plus the healthy fat. On 
your high-carb days, eat more by adding mostly starchy carbs like rice, oats, yams, and potatoes until 
you hit maintenance calories. 
You don‘t need to make it more complicated than that. In fact, enjoy the process! Everyone loves 
high-carb day. It‘s a welcome relief from the traditional low-carbs-all-the-time diets, so it‘s not only 
more effective, it‘s easier. Some even say it‘s fun! 
CONCLUSION 
That‘s it! You‘ve just learned some of the most powerful fat-loss techniques in existence. But 
remember: Any diet taken to an extreme can do more harm than good, and that includes the low-carb 
diet. In Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle, there are progressive phases with increasing reductions in 
carbs and corresponding increases in protein, but nowhere do I recommend the complete removal of 
carbs. Nowhere do I say carbs are evil or completely off-limits. Sensible and strategic carb 
manipulation with increased protein to accelerate the fat-loss process? Absolutely! Zero- or close-to-
zero-carb diets? No, thanks!

CALORIE WORKSHEET 
The Averages Method 
Use this method if want a ballpark estimate and you don‘t want to do any math. Use the lower end of 
the ranges if you are small-framed and/or inactive. Use the high end of the ranges if you are large-
framed and/or active. (These numbers are based on the average man or woman. If your body size or 
activity levels are much higher than average, use one of the other methods). 
AVERAGE DAILY CALORIE INTAKES FOR FAT LOSS

The Harris/Benedict and Katch/McArdle Formulas 
Use this four-step method if you want the most accurate estimate of your ideal calorie needs based on 
body size and activity level and you don‘t mind crunching a few numbers. If you don‘t know your 
lean body mass, use the Harris/Benedict equation to calculate your BMR. 

================================================================================
STEP 1: CALCULATE YOUR BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR). OPTION (A): 
HARRIS/BENEDICT EQUATION 
Men 
BMR = (13.7 × weight in kg.) + (5 × height in cm.) − (6.8 × age) 
Women 
BMR = 655 + (9.6 × weight in kg.) + (1.8 × height in cm.) − (4.7 × age) 
Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) 
  
STEP 1: CALCULATE YOUR BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR). OPTION (B): 
KATCH/MCARDLE EQUATION 
Men and Women 
BMR = 370 + (21.6 × lean mass in kg.) 
Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) 
  
STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR ACTIVITY LEVEL (MULTIPLIER). 
Activity Level 
Multiplier 
Description 
Sedentary 
BMR × 1.2 
Little or no exercise, desk job 
Lightly Active 
BMR × 1.375 Light exercise or sports 3–5 days/week 
Moderately Active

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle has been through many evolutions, and putting this book into a brand-
new print edition was a huge team effort. I‘d like to express my gratitude to everyone who helped. 
First, I‘d like to thank, once again, Stephen Barbara of Foundry Literary media. Without your support, 
encouragement, and persistence over a long period of time, this book would not be in our hands in 
hardcover. Endless thanks to Yfat Reiss-Gendell, also of Foundry Literary. I‘m glad you are on our 
team. And thanks to everyone else at Foundry. 
I‘m thrilled to have the honor of being published by Random House/Harmony. I‘d like to thank 
everyone who has been involved in every way from start to finish. In particular, I want to thank editor 
Mary Choteborsky for the amount of time, effort, and creativity put into this project. The 
improvements in this new version of the book are fantastic, and the new content, improved format, 
increased user-friendliness, and a lot more can be in large part credited to you. 
To Lee Allen Howard: Thank you for your editorial help, not just in this new edition, but through 
two iterations of the book. Your feedback has helped in many ways, especially in helping make Burn 
the Fat, Feed the Muscle as streamlined as a ―bible‖ of fat loss can be. 
Special thanks to: Dr. Chris Mohr, RD, our go- to guy for registered dietician advice and the nicest 
guy in the business. Will Brink: the first person to ever promote the early editions of Burn the Fat, 
Feed the Muscle online—your support has always been remembered and appreciated. Christian Finn: 
Thank you for your outstanding contributions to our field and for supporting Burn the Fat, Feed the 
Muscle all these years. Brad Schoenfeld: I appreciate your work and you generously giving me your 
time to chat about the science of muscle. I hope this book finally achieves that perfect balance 
between the science and the art. Alan Aragon: Thanks for your feedback and all the great work in 
evidence-based fitness. Shawn Phillips: Thanks for keeping us strong and always making us think. 
Kostas Marangopoulos: Thanks for everything, including being the number one advocate and 
supporter of Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle and everything it stands for since day one. John Sifferman, 
Lee Wennerberg, Leigh Peele, and Scott Tousignant: Thanks for your feedback on the new material at 
various stages of rewriting. 
Thank you to the whole Burn the Fat online team: webmasters, blogmasters, site managers, admins, 
assistants, programmers, contributors, guest writers, and challenge judges. Big thanks to Matt Dietz, 
webmaster extraordinaire: We wouldn‘t have been online for so many years without you. Kyle Battis 
and Dominick Iosca: Thank you for all your support and behind the scenes work. Without you guys, 
the Burn the Fat Challenge would not keep happening. Simon Harrison, blogmaster and jack of all 
other Internet trades: Thanks for your help so far, and for what is yet to come. 
I‘m grateful to all our members at the Burn the Fat Inner Circle. We have the best, most unique 
support group in the world; it‘s like family. I‘d like to thank all our Burn the Fat challenge winners 
and hall-of-famers for your participation and congratulate you for your achievements in our Burn the 
Fat events. To our star members: Some of you shine super-bright and burn ultra-hot; you know who 
you are and you have lit the way for many others. To all of our Burn the Fat fans and followers who 
have shared your transformation success stories: Thank you. You‘ve not only transformed yourselves 
but also inspired thousands of others through your examples, and you are more influential than you 
think. 
To all our hundreds of thousands of original Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle readers and Burn the 
Fat newsletter subscribers: I thank all of you for your support. I appreciate everyone who posted 
comments and sent me encouraging emails; above all else, your personal messages are what kept me 
going all these years. 

================================================================================
To every affiliate and partner who supported Burn the Fat online: Thank you. The next chapter is 
just beginning and I look forward to continuing to work with you. 
To my family: Thank you for supporting all the work I do and how I do it. 
And to every new reader of this book who is on the path of lifelong self-improvement: I applaud 
your commitment and thank you for putting your faith in this program and in me.

HIGH PULLEY CURLS
Stand between the pulleys, spread your arms, and grasp the high pulley handles with an underhand grip:
- Inhale and curl the handles toward your head
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This exercise
is mostly used to complete a workout focusing on arm development.
It works mainly the
biceps—particularly the long head, which
is first stretched and tensed while your arms are spread. This
exercise also works the brachialis.
Never use heavy weight with
this exercise. Concentrate on
feeling the proper contraction along the
medial part of the biceps.

the
force
exerted on

ARMS
Stand. Keep your back straight and take an underhand grip on the bar with your hands slightly more than
shoulder-width apart:
- Inhale, then curl the barbell
- Contract the gluteal, abdominal and back muscles isometrically to avoid torso swing
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This exercise mainly works the biceps, brachialis, and, to a lesser degree, the
brachioradialis, pronator teres, and
all the flexors of the wrist and fingers.
Variations:
1. Try using various grip widths to more intensely work
- the biceps short head (wide grip) or
- the biceps long head (narrow grip).
2.
Lift your elbows at the end of the curl to get a better biceps contraction
and to involve the anterior deltoids.
3. To make this movement more rigorous and controlled, place your back
against a wall and keep your scapulae (shoulder blades) pressed against the
wall.
i
VARIATIONS
Narrow grip: mainly works the biceps long head.
Wide grip: mainly works the biceps short head.

================================================================================
STRENGTH TRAINING ANATOMY
MACHINE CURLS
Performing the biceps curls with the Atlas pulley
is
a great way to pump up the muscle.
Sit and take an underhand grip on the bar with your arms straight and your elbows resting on the
padded and angled surface of the table:
- Inhale and curl the bar
- Exhale as you complete the movement
BEGINNING OF MOVEMENT
Stemocleidomastoideus
Scalenus
Triceps brachii,
lateral head
Pectoral is major
Biceps brachii
Brachialis
Trapezius
Omohyoideus
Deltoideus
This
is one of the best exercises to feel the action of the biceps. This movement also works the
brachialis and, to a lesser extent, the brachioradialis and pronator teres.
It
is impossible to cheat
because your arms are firmly held on the table. The muscular tension
is intense at the beginning, so
warm up by using light loads. Avoid tendinitis by keeping your arms from extending completely.

================================================================================
ARMS
PREACHER CURLS
Stand or sit with your arms resting on the bench:
- Inhale and curl the bar
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This
is one of the best isolation exercises for the biceps.
Warning: the angle of the bench creates significant tension
in your arms when they are fully
extended. Remember to warm up your muscles correctly and to begin with moderate weight.

Stand with your feet slightly apart and your arms straight, using an overhand grip (thumbs toward each other):
- Inhale and curl the bar
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This exercise works the extensors of the wrist and fingers.
It works the brachioradialis, brachialis, and, to a lesser degree, the biceps.
Note: this
is an excellent movement for strengthening the wrist joint. The predominance of the wrist flexors over the wrist extensors often
causes imbalance and weakens the wrist. For this reason, this exercise has been integrated into many boxers' training programs. Many bench
press champions use
it to prevent their wrists from shaking when using heavy weight.

Stand facing the machine with your hands on the bar and
your elbows against your sides:
- Inhale and
straighten your arms,
but don't separate
your elbows from your sides
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This
isolation exercise works the triceps and the anco-
neus.
You can perform an effective variation of this movement
with a rope instead of the bar to work the lateral head of
the
triceps more
intensely. Use an underhand
grip
to
place emphasis on the medial head of the triceps.
At the end of the movement, hold an isometric contrac-
tion for one or two seconds to feel the effort more inten-
sely.
If you use a heavy weight,
lean
slightly forward
at the
waist for more stability.
This exercise
is very easy to perform and can be done by
beginners to help develop strength before moving to more
difficult exercises.
VARIATION WITH A ROPE
Enables you to feel the effort of the

VARIATIONS
1. Lower the bar toward your forehead to work primarily the medial and lateral heads of the triceps.
2. Lower the bar behind your head to work primarily the long head of the triceps.
Lie on a flat bench and take an overhand grip on the bar with your arms extended:
- Inhale and bend your elbows, making sure you don't allow them to flare to the sides
- Return to the starting position, exhaling as you complete the movement
This fundamental movement
is excellent for developing larger triceps.
To make this movement easier, you can use an ove-
'head triceps machine. This allows for greater concen-
tration on the triceps long head.

ACTION
Sit on a bench with your back straight. Grasp a barbell with an overhand grip and rest the barbell
across your shoulders behind your neck:
- Inhale and press the barbell directly above your head without arching your back
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This exercise works the deltoids, particularly the medial part, and the upper trapezius, triceps, and
serratus anterior.
It also works the rhomboids, infraspinatus, teres minor, and supraspinatus.
You can also perform this movement while standing or by setting the bar on a rack. There are
many machines that allow you to do this exercise with less concentration on form and safety.
fVofe;to avoid traumatizing the shoulder joint, which
is particularly delicate, rest the bar higher
or lower behind your neck according to your body type and flexibility. This exercise can be stre-
nuous on the rotator cuff muscles and should be performed with caution.

SHOULDERS
ACTION
FRONT PRESS
Sit with your back straight. Take an overhand grip on the barbell and rest
it on your upper chest:
- Inhale and press the barbell straight up
- Exhale at the top of the movement
This basic exercise works the following muscles:
-Anterior and medial deltoids
- Upper pectorals
- Upper trapezius
- Triceps
- Serratus anterior
You can perform this exercise while standing, but you must avoid hyperextension of the spine.
Place your elbows slighty forward for more work on the anterior deltoids. To involve the medial
deltoids more intensely, flare out your elbows. Many machines and racks allow you to perform
this movement with less concentration on the correct position, which helps you focus on the del-
toids.

DUMBBELLS: 1. to the sides 2. behind the buttocks 3. in front of the thighs.
This exercise
isolates, almost exclusively, the medial deltoids, which
are composed of several pennate heads converging on the humerus.
They are involved when you hold relatively heavy weight and enable
you to move your arms with precision
in every plane.
It
is more effec-
tive to train this muscle by starting at different positions (hands to the
sides, behind
the
buttocks,
or
in
front of the
thighs)
to
involve the
medial deltoids completely.

EXTENSION VARIATIONS
1. Arms extended horizontally—deltoid action.
2. Arms extended above the horizontal plane—trapezius (anterior heads) action.
This exercise also works the supraspinatus, located beneath the deltoid
muscle
in the supraspinatus fossa of the scapula and inserted into the
humeral large tuberosity.
Because body types vary, you must find an optimal angle of work that
meets the needs of your physique.
You can stress the upper part of the trapezius by raising the arms above
the horizontal plane. However, many bodybuilders avoid doing this to
place primary emphasis on the medial deltoid.
This exercise
is never performed with heavy weight. Sets of 10 to 25
reps give the best results
if you vary the angle of work, spend
little time
recovering, and train to the point of feeling the burning sensation.

This exercise places primary emphasis on the ante-
rior deltoids and upper pectorals and,
to
a
lesser
extent, on the middle deltoids. Every arm raise exer-
v
cise also involves the muscles that attach the scapu-
lae (shoulder blades) to the rib cage, such as the ser-
ratus

SIDE-LYING LATERAL RAISES
Lie on your side on the floor or a bench, holding a dumbbell with an overhand grip:
- Inhale and raise your arm
- Exhale as you complete the movement
Unlike standing raises, which gradually work the muscle to maximum intensity at the end of the movement (when you bring your arms to a
horizontal position), this exercise involves the deltoids differently, concentrating the effort at the beginning of the movement.
Note: this movement emphasizes the supraspinatus, mainly working at the beginning of the movement. Vary the starting position (dumbbell
placed forward, on the thigh, or toward the rear) to place the emphasis on
all of the deltoid heads.

NORMAL BENCH PRESS
Keep your feet flat on the floor for more stability.
This exercise focuses on the pectorals and places secondary emphasis on the triceps, anterior
deltoids, serratus, and coracobrachialis.
Variations
:
1. Arch your back to work the more powerful lower pectorals and
lift heavier loads. However,
perform this variation carefully to reduce the likelihood of injury to your back.
2. Press the barbell with your elbows at your sides to focus more on the anterior deltoids.
3. Vary the width of your grip:
- A narrow grip shifts the focus to the inner pectorals
- A very wide grip shifts the focus to the outer pectorals
4. Lower the bar
- to the lower chest (near the edge of the rib cage) to work the lower pectorals;
- to the middle of the chest to work the medial pectorals; and
- to the upper chest/lower neck area to work the upper pectorals.
5. Raise your feet from the floor by curling your legs over your abdominals
if you have back
problems or
if you want to place more emphasis on the pectorals.
6. Use a Smith-machine.
42

================================================================================
CHEST
VARIATION
ARCHING YOUR BACK
If you arch your back to perform the bench press, you can use much heavier weight
because you will place much more stress on the lower pectorals.
At competition level, you must not move your feet and head.
In addition, your but-
tocks should always remain in contact with the bench.
People who have back problems must avoid this variation.
VARIATION
LEGS CURLED UP
Curl your legs over your lower torso to avoid extreme arch and lower back pain.
This variation can also be used to decrease the emphasis on the lower pectorals,
shifting
it to the medial and upper pectorals.

- Exhale at the end of the movement
This safe exercise
is excellent for beginners.
It focuses on the pectorals and keeps your
body set in the prescribed movement pattern. Beginners can gain strength this way before
trying the free weight bench press.
Depending on the type of machine, this exercise allows advanced bodybuilders to isolate
the work on the upper, medial, or lower pectorals, helping them develop muscle balance.

- Inhale and bend your elbows to allow your body to sink as far down between
the bars as possible
- Reverse the motion and return to the starting point, exhaling as you comple-
te the movement
The more you bend forward, the more you
work

pectorals.
Conversely,
the
more
you
straighten
your
torso,
the
more
you
involve the triceps.
This exercise
is excellent for stretching the pectoralis major and increasing the flexibility of the pectoral gird-
le. However,
it is not recommended to beginners because
it requires sufficient strength. To that purpose, use
the machine to master the technique.
Sets of 10 to 20 reps give the best results. To gain more power and size, experienced athletes can hang a
dumbbell between their legs or place barbell plates around their waist.

dumbbell flys—works the pectorals (particularly the upper part)
while stretching them.
It also works the anterior deltoids, ser-
k ratus anterior, and pectoralis minor (both stabilize the scapulae, allowing the arm to work with
the torso), and the triceps.
Variation: to isolate the effort on the upper pectorals, start the movement with an overhand grip
and rotate your wrists so the dumbbells face each other.

PART OF PECTORAL MUSCLES
MAINLY WORKED
Lie on an incline bench set at an angle between 45 and 60 degrees. Hold the
dumbbells with your arms extended or slightly bent to lessen the stress on the
elbow joint:
- Inhale, then lower the dumbbells until your elbows are at shoulder height
- Raise the dumbbells while exhaling
Never perform this movement with heavy weight. This exercise isolates the
pectorals (particularly the upper part). With the pullover,
it
is one of the basic
exercises to stretch your rib cage.

Variation:
If you stick out your chest, you can pull yourself up so the bar touches your chin. To increase the intensity, you will need added resistance
attached to your body. When you pull your elbows to the rear and stick out your chest until your chin reaches the level of the bar, the move-
ment mainly involves the upper and
lats, as well as the teres major.
In monkeys and men,
the teres major and latissimus dorsi
are well developed.
This exercise adds thickness to the back. When you pinch your scapulae together, the
rhomboids and the inferior part of the trapezius are also worked.
EVOLUTIONARY THEORY
Originally, the
teres major and
latissimus dorsi were involved
in making our
remote ancestors walk on
all fours. They mainly worked on the forelegs as re-
verse
thrusters.
With
the
transition
to
arboreal
life,
they became
powerful
muscles specialized
in vertical movement. When our ancestors returned to the
ground, they adopted bipedalism but kept their ability to climb trees. For this
reason, we
still have powerful back muscles that allow us to pull ourselves up
and climb trees, walls, ladders, and so forth.
Note: the main difference between our locomotor system and that of the apes
lies
in the development of our lower limbs, which are specialized for bipedalism. Our
chest and upper limbs have quite the same structure and proportions as those of the
apes. Contrarily to fallacies, apes don't have long arms: humans have long legs.

Extend your arms and take an underhand grip on the bar with your hands shoulder-width apart:
- Inhale and stick your chest out to pull yourself upward until your chin
is at the level of the bar
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This movement develops the lats and teres major.
It places intense focus on the biceps and brachialis. For that reason
it can be integrated into
a program focused on training the arm region. The trapezius (middle and lower portions), rhomboids, and pectorals are also involved.
This exercise requires greater strength.
It
is easier to perform using a high pulley.

Stand with your feet placed fairly close to each other, facing the bar on the floor. Bend for-
ward at the waist, keeping your back arched and,
if possible, your legs straight. Take an over-
hand grip on the bar, with your arms relaxed:
- Inhale and straighten your body, flexing at the hips and keeping your back rigid
- Exhale as you complete the movement and return the bar back to the floor, keeping your
back straight
This exercise involves all the spinal erectors. When you flex at the hips to straighten your
body,
it specifically works the muscles of the hips, buttocks, and thighs (but not the thigh

The stiff-legged deadlift exercise stretches the back of your thighs.
In order to increase the
range of motion, perform the exercise while standing on a thick block of wood.
Warning: people with back problems should perform this exercise with caution because of
the high amount of stress on the lumbar spine.

Stand facing the bar with your feet slightly spread. Keep your back motionless and a
little arched. Flex your knees until your thighs are almost
parallel to the floor. Depending on your physique and the flexibility of your ankles, you can vary this position (for example,
if your thigh bones
and arms are short, place your thighs
in a horizontal position
;
if your thigh bones and arms are long, place your thighs a
little above your
knees). Take an overhand grip on the bar, with your hands slightly more than shoulder-width apart (you can also use an over-under grip (one
palm faces forward and the other faces back) to prevent the bar from rolling and to work with much heavier weight):
- Inhale, contract your abdominal and low back muscles, and
lift the bar by straightening your legs (contracting your abdominals and keeping
your back straight), raising
it in front of your shins
- When the bar reaches your knees, extend your torso so you are standing erect with your arms straight down at your sides, exhaling as you
complete the movement
- Hold this straightened position for 2 seconds, then return the weight to the floor, making sure you do not hyperextend or arch your back
This exercise works virtually every muscle.
It builds terrific hip, lower back, and trapezius muscle mass.
It also involves the buttocks and qua-
driceps. With the bench press and the squat,
it
is one of the movements performed
in powerlifting events.

In any movement, whenever you use heavy weight, you must "block."
1. Stick out your chest by taking a deep breath and filling your lungs with air like a balloon.
In this way, you will stiffen your rib cage and
prevent your upper torso from bending forward.
2. Contract all the abdominal muscles to increase intra-abdominal pressure so your shoulders are pulled back when you are in the top posi-
tion of the movement.
3. Finally, contract the lower back muscles to arch your lower back and extend the bottom of the spine.
These three simultaneous actions are called "blocking." Their function
is to avoid rounding the back (or flexing the spine), which may cause
a slipped disk
if you work with heavy weight.

SUMO DEADLIFTS
HOW TO PERFORM SUMO DEADLIFTS
End of movement
Stand facing the bar. Place your feet considerably wider than shoulder-width apart with
your toes pointing outward, keeping them in line with your knees:
- Flex your knees until your thighs are parallel to the floor
- Take an overhand grip on the bar with your hands about shoulder-width apart, keeping
your arms straight (use an over-under grip to
lift heavier loads)
- Inhale, hold your breath, slightly arch your back, shoulders backward, contract your
abdominals and straighten your legs, extending your torso to stand erect. Exhale.
Unlike normal
deadlifts,
this exercise places primary emphasis on the quadriceps and
adductors and secondary emphasis on the back, because
it
is not as much bend as at the
beginning.
When you
lift heavy weight, be sure to do this movement very carefully; execute the prop-
er technique to avoid traumatizing the hips and the adductors of the thighs, as well as the
connection between the sacrum and the lumbar vertebrae, which
is directly involved
in
the exercise.
The sumo deadlift
is one of the three powerlifting movements.
Note: at the beginning of the movement, make sure you
raise the bar
in front of your
tibias. At the end of the movement, keep your back straight, holding your breath.

This exercise places primary emphasis on the buttocks and thigh biceps (except the thigh biceps
short head) and secondary emphasis on the spinal erectors and other lower back muscles.
In
addition,
flexing the upper body completely
is excellent
for stretching
all
the sacrospinalis
muscles. Placing your pelvis on the front padded surface moves the axis of flexion forward and
isolates the work on the sacrospinalis, but with
less intensity because of the limited range of
movement and increased leverage.
You can hold the hyperextension for a few seconds
to help isolate the work.
Beginners can perform
this exercise on a specific
incline bench for more comfort.
Variation: with a specific machine, you can isolate
the stress on the sacrospinalis.

STRENGTH TRAINING ANATOMY
Stand with your feet slightly spread. Keep your back straight. Take an overhand grip on the bar
with your hands palm-width apart or a
little more:
- Inhale and pull the barbell straight upward until
it contacts your chin
- Lift your elbows as high as possible at the top point of the movement
- Exhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting point
This exercise works the upper trapezius and
medial-posterior deltoid groups most
intensely.
Secondary emphasis
is placed on the anterior deltoids, biceps, forearm flexors, abdominals, but-
tocks, and sacrospinal is.
The wider your grip, the more the movement works the deltoids and the less
it works the trape-
zius muscles.

The squat
is the number one bodybuilding movement because
it involves a large part of the muscular system. To perform
it, place a barbell
on a squat rack. Duck under the bar and position
it across your shoulders on the trapezius, slighly above the posterior part of the deltoids. Grasp
the bar using a grip width appropriate to your body type and pull your elbows to the rear:
- Inhale deeply (to maintain intrathoracic pressure and prevent your-
self from bending forward) and slightly arch your back by rotating your
pelvis forward
- Look straight ahead and
lift the bar off the rack
- Move back a step or two from the rack and set your feet shoulder-
width apart, keeping your
toes
pointed
forward
or
slightly angled outward
- Slowly bend your knees
and
squat

back slighly bent forward

When you flex your spine, the intervertebral disks are pinched at
the front and gape at the back. The fluid of-the nucleus pulposus

lumbago or sciatica).

- To avoid injury, keep your back straight (the axis of flexion runs through the hip-
thigh joint)
- Once your thighs are parallel to the floor, extend your legs and straighten your
torso to return to the starting (upright) position
- Exhale as you complete the movement
Squats particularly work the quadriceps, gluteals, adductors, spinal erectors, abdo-
minals, and hamstrings.
-Variations
:
(1)
If you have inflexible ankles or long thigh bones, rest your heels on a block of
wood to avoid bending too far forward. This variation shifts part of the stress to the
quadriceps. However, this variation can position the knees too far forward for safe
lifting so use
it with caution.
(2) You can position the bar lower, across your upper deltoids, to improve your
balance and
increase the
lifting power of your back, which allows you
to use
heavier weight. This technique
is mostly used by powerlifters.
(3) You can do squats on a specific machine to prevent yourself from bending for-
ward and isolate stress on the quadriceps.
REGULAR SQUAT
FULL SQUAT
1. PROPER POSITIONS:
When doing squats, always keep your back as upright as
possible.
There
are
differences
in body
types
(legs
of
different
lengths, ankles more or less flexible) and different ways
to execute the technique (experimenting with
different
t'oot-stance widths, using platform shoes or heelpieces,
resting
the
barbell
higher
or
lower
on
the
traps).
Consequently, your torso will be more or less inclined,
but be sure to bend forward at thight joint.
2. IMPROPER POSITION:
Never
flex
the
spine
while
doing
squats.
This
error
contributes to most low back injuries, especially slipped
disks.
In order to correctly feel the action of the gluteals,
it
is
important to bend your knees until your thighs are
parallel to the floor.
1-3: NEGATIVE PHASE OF REGULAR SQUAT
4. FULL SQUAT:
To place more emphasis on the gluteals, you can bring
your
thighs
into
a
position
below
the
horizontal.
However, use
this technique only
if you have flexible
ankles or short thigh bones. In addition, do the full squat
carefully because
it tends to
flex the spine, which can
lead to serious injuries.
In any movement, whenever you use heavy weight, you must "block."
1. Stick out your chest by taking a deep breath and filling your lungs with air like a balloon.
In this way, you will
stiffen your rib cage and
prevent your upper torso from bending forward.
2. Contract all the abdominal muscles to increase intra-abdominal pressure so your shoulders are pulled back when you are in the top posi-
tion of the movement.
3. Finally, contract the lower back muscles to arch your lower back and extend the bottom of the spine.
These three simultaneous actions are called "blocking." Their function
is to avoid rounding the back (or flexing the spine), which will cause
a slipped disk
if you work with heavy weight.

As with front squats, you place pri-

if
you wedge your legs on a specific
machine.
Position the barbell across your anterior deltoids, hold your upper
arms parallel to the floor, bend your elbows, cross your forearms,
grasp the bar, and look straight ahead:
- Inhale and squat down
- Return to the starting point, exhale as you complete the move-
ment
While doing front squats, you must not bend forward, but keep your
back perfectly straight. You can rest your heels on a block of wood
to improve your balance, but doing so might move your knees too
far forward for safe lifting.
This type
of squat
places
primary emphasis on
the quadriceps.
Always use
lighter weights than
in the conventional
squat. This
good all-around exercise also works the gluteals, hamstrings, abdo-
minals, and the spinal erectors.
Weightl ifters often use this movement because
it works the thigh
muscles exactly the same way as when doing cleans or finishing snatches.

If you place your feet lower on the footplate, you will primarily stress your quadriceps. Conversely,
if you place your feet on the top of the
footplate, you will
shift more emphasis to the buttocks and hamstrings.
If you spread your legs, the adductors will be more involved.
If you

Flex your knees, place your back against the padded
surface, wedge your shoulders beneath the
yokes attached to the machine, and place your feet fairly close together:
- Inhale, rotate the stop handles at the sides of the yokes to release the machine, and bend your legs
- Return to the starting position, exhaling as you complete the movement
This movement maximizes emphasis on the quadriceps.
If you place your feet close together, you will
place more emphasis on the gluteals.
If you spread your feet, you will shift the work to the adductors.
To protect your back from injury, be sure to contract your abdominals in order to avoid swinging your
pelvis and spine.

Sit on the machine. Grasp either the handles or the edges of the sea-
ting platform
to steady your body throughout the movement. Bend
your knees and place your ankles under the set of roller pads:
- Inhale and raise your legs until they are almost parallel to
the floor
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This
is the best quadriceps isolation movement. The more
you incline the back of the seat, the more your pelvis
is
til-
ted backward. The rectus femoris will then be stretched and
will be more intensely worked as you raise your legs.
This exercise
is recommended for beginners.
It allows you to
gain enough
strength
before trying more technical move-
ments.

Lie facedown on the padded surface of the machine. Grasp the handles, straighten your knees and
hook your feet under the set of roller pads:
- Inhale and simultaneously raise your feet upward until your knees are as fully bent as possible (try
to touch your buttocks with your heels)
- Exhale as you complete the movement
- Slowly return to the starting position
This exercise involves the entire hamstring group as well as the gastrocnemius.
In theory, as you curl
your feet upward you can place more emphasis on either the semitendinosus and semimembranosus
(by angling your toes inward) or on the biceps femoris long and short heads (by angling your toes out-
ward). However,
in practice
it turns out to be difficult, and only the placing of primary emphasis on
the hamstrings or gastrocnemius
is easy:
- feet extended puts more stress on the hamstrings
feet dorsiflexed puts more stress on the gastrocnemius
Variation: you can perform this exercise with one leg at a time or by holding a barbell with both feet.

Stand with your feet slightly apart. Place a barbell across your trapezius muscles or a
little lower across your posterior deltoids:
- Inhale and bend forward at the waist until your torso
is roughly parallel to the floor,
being sure to keep your back straight
- Return to the starting position, exhaling
To make the movement easier, you can
slightly
bend your knees. This exercise involves the glu-
teals and
spinal
erectors,
and
particularly
the
hamstrings (except the biceps femoris short head,
which only
flexes the
leg).
Besides
flexing the
knee, the main function of the hamstrings
is
til-
ting the pelvis backward, straightening the upper
body
if the latest interact to contract the abdomi-
nals and sacrospinalis isometrically.
To
get
better
construction
in
the
hamstrings,
never do
this movement with heavy weight.
In
this exercise, the negative phase
is excellent for
stretching the back of your thighs.
If you do
it
regularly,
it will reduce the likelihood of injury
when doing heavy squats.
This exercise does pose a high risk to the lumbar
spine, so perform
it with caution.

Stand with your back straight. Place your shoulders under the pads of the yoke. Place your toes and the balls of your feet on the toe block and
lower your heels (dorsiflexion):
- Rise up as high as you can on your toes (plantarflexion) while keeping your knees extended
- Return to the starting position
This exercise works the triceps surae (composed of the soleus and gas-
trocnemius, lateral and medial heads). To stretch your muscles correctly,
be sure to rise up as high as possible on your toes as you perform every
repetition.
In theory,
it
is possible to isolate the stress on the gastrocne-
mius medial head (toes out) or on the gastrocnemius lateral head (toes in),
but
in practice, this
is difficult to achieve. Hovyever, you can easily shift
the emphasis from the gastrocnemius to the soleus by flexing your knees
to relax the gastrocnemius.
Variation: you may also do this exercise at the Smith-machine, using a
block or plates under your toes for greater range of motion. You may also
place a bar on your shoulders, without the block, but thus, with a lesser
range of motion.

- In the bottom position, the top of your forward thigh
is slightly below parallel
- Return to the starting position, exhaling
This exercise places primary emphasis on the gluteals.
You can vary the stride length by taking (1
) a simple step
forward to specifically involve the quadriceps, or (2) a
large step forward
to place more
stress on the ham-
strings and gluteals while stretching the upper quadri-
ceps and hip flexors of the back leg.

Place one foot on the footplate and place the outer side of your other leg against the pad below
your knee (close to your ankle):
- Move this leg as high to the side as possible
- Note the abduction
is limited because the neck of the femur (thigh bone)
is rapidly stopped on
the rim of the cup into which the femur fits at the pelvis
This exercise
is excellent for developing the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus, which has
the same function as the anterior fibers of the gluteus medius.
It also works tensor fascia latae.

VARIATION
Bend forward at the waist to place more emphasis

Sit at an abductor machine:
- Slowly force your legs apart
as far as comfortably possible
- Return to the starting posi-
tion and repeat
If the machine's seat
is
incli-
ned, you
will work the glu-
teus medius.
If the machine's
seat
is upright, you will work
the gluteus maximus. Ideally,
you should vary the
inclina-
tion of your torso in every set.
Simply bend at the waist. For
example: 10 reps with upper
body against the back of the
seat followed by
1 0 reps with
upper body bent forward
at
the waist.
This exercise
is an excellent way to increase muscle tone to the upper part of the hip.
It
gives the buttocks a rounded appearance, making your waist look slimmer.

Although
this
is
a much-debated
topic,
if you have lower back
problems, you
should keep your hip motionless in order to neutralize the action of the psoas and
prevent abnormal forward curvature of the spine (lordosis) or other spinal patho-
logies.
Therefore,
it
is
better
to
stress the
rectus abdominis without
stretching them, by
moving the sternum (breastbone) closer to the pubis with short contractions. /k

head:
- Inhale and
lift your shoulders off the floor
- Try to touch your knees with your head
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This exercise focuses on the rectus abdominis, particularly above the navel. By placing your torso far-
ther from the bench you increase pelvic mobility which allows your torso upward by contracting the
iliopsoas, tensor fasciae latae, and rectus femoris in order to flex the hips.

Sit on the bench and hook your feet under the
roller pads. Place your hands
behind your neck:
- Inhale and incline your torso less than 20 degrees
- Move your torso back up, slightly curling your torso to place more stress on the
rectus abdominis
- Exhale as you complete the movement
This exercise works the entire rectus abdominis muscle wall, as well as the iliop-
soas, tensor fasciae latae, and rectus femoris in the quadriceps group. The func-
tion of these last three muscles
is to tilt the pelvis forward.
Variation: as you move back up, you can twist alternately to each side on suc-
cessive repetitions to shift part of the stress to the obliques.

BROOMSTICK TWISTS
Stand with your feet spread. Hold a broomstick across your trapezius, above the posterior
deltoids. Make sure you don't pull or hang too much on the broomstick:
- Rotate your upper body from side to side
- Keep your pelvis (hips) motionless by contracting the gluteals isometrically throughout the
movement
As you
rotate your right shoulder forward,
this movement works the right external oblique,
left internal oblique, and, to a lesser extent, the rectus abdominis and the
left spinal erectors.
To add intensity, you may slightly round your back. This exercise can also be done while sit-
ting on a bench with your legs straddling the bench to keep your hips stationary and isolate
the abdominals.

- Return to the starting position, or move slightly farther to the other side by bending at the waist passively
Be sure to do an equal number of sets and reps with the dumbbell held
in each hand. Don't rest between the sets.
This exercise focuses on the obliques of the side you bend with and places secondary emphasis on the rectus abdominis and quadratus lum-

Introduction 
Cooking - it’s either something you love or something you hate, and 
funnily enough this perception is more often than not based on your 
cooking abilities! As a health and fitness advocate | have spent endless 
hours in the kitchen trying to follow complex recipes with obscure 
ingredients and utensils | didn’t have to create bland meals | didn’t enjoy. 
If you are on a ‘diet’ or trying to gain lean muscle you will more than likely 
have gone through a phase of desensitizing yourself to foods, don’t worry 
| went through that stage too! Cooking is meant to be fun, after several 
years of trial and error in the kitchen | have compiled 160 of my favorite 
muscle building and fat burning recipes that are easy to make and don’t 
require any complex ingredients or utensils. 
The recipes within this book include breakfasts, main meals, snacks and 
desserts, protein smoothies and sides. All of these meals are loaded with 
flavour, and even better they are loaded with protein and nutrients. Every 
recipe has the total number of calories along with a macronutrient 
breakdown stating the amount of protein, carbohydrates and fats per 
serve (measured in grams). 
If you’re anything like me you’ll have a sweet tooth for berry pancakes, 
Boston cream donuts and a variety of other mouth-watering sweet foods. 
In this book | will show you how to EASILY make these and be able to 
incorporate them into your diet DAILY if you wish while still achieving 
your fat loss/muscle gain goals. 
It’s time to debunk the ‘clean eating’ myth! 

================================================================================
The IIFYM Flexible Dieting Cookbook Explained 
First of all, let’s clarify flexible dieting. Flexible dieting is more of a lifestyle 
then an actual diet. Flexible dieting eliminates ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’ foods 
and instead focuses on the bigger picture — your daily caloric needs. 
Flexible dieting thrives off the principle that a calorie is a calorie and 
which source it comes from will have no effect on body composition. You 
can gain fat eating ‘clean’ foods if you exceed the daily amount of calories 
your body requires just like you can lose fat eating ‘dirty’ foods as long as 
_ 
the total calories consumed are below that of your maintenance level. 
IIFYM, short for ‘If it Fits Your Macros’ refers to choosing foods that fit 
your daily macronutrient goal. 
This cookbook contains a plethora of delicious recipes, all with 
macronutrient breakdowns; therefore you know exactly how many grams 
of protein, carbohydrates and fat are within each recipe along with the 
total caloric number that you can then use to reach your caloric goal for 
the day. 

================================================================================
Calories & Macronutrients Explained 
So what is a calorie? 
A calorie is an energy source, humans require calories in order to 
maintain life. We are constantly trying to increase and decrease our 
caloric intake based on our goals such as: whether we want to slim down, 
gain lean muscle mass or perform a certain way for sports. If a calorie 
that is consumed is not utilised it will be converted by the body and 
stored as fat — this calorie could be from a stick of celery or a scoop of ice 
cream, it is irrelevant. 
Calories can come from several different macronutrient sources, these 
include: 
Protein — 4 calories per gram— protein is the building block for lean 
muscle mass. 
Carbohydrates — 4 calories per gram — carbohydrates are used by our 
bodies as the primary energy source. Carbohydrates are broken down 
into 2 sub categories (both contain 4 cal/gram). 
Simple carbohydrates — these are the sugary processed carbohydrates 
that are found in foods such as lollies, chocolate and fruit. Simple 
carbohydrates are absorbed quickly and cause a large insulin spike. 
Complex carbohydrates — These carbohydrates are the ‘clean’ slow 
digesting carbohydrates that are known for sustained energy. Complex 
carbs are found in brown rice, sweet potato and oats. 
Fat — 9 calories per gram — Healthy fats are vital for bodily functions such 
as hormone levels. Fats are also broken down into several categories: 
Saturated fat — found in dairy and meat, can raise cholesterol. 
Unsatured fat — found in vegetable oils, used to lower cholesterol. 
Alcohol — 7 calories per gram — empty calories (alcohol does not contain 
any macronutrients). 

================================================================================
Calculating your Macronutrient Requirement 
In order to begin your flexible diet you need to know your daily caloric 
goal! In order to calculate this goal the following formula is used, please 
note the slight variation in formula for men and women: 
Based on the extremely accurate Mifflin - St Jeor equation 
MEN: BMR = [9.99 x weight (kg)] + [6.25 x height (cm)] - [4.92 x age 
(years)] +5 
WOMEN: BMR = [9.99 x weight (kg)] + [6.25 x height (cm)] - [4.92 x age 
(years)] -161 
The above equation will give you your BMR — this is your Basal Metabolic 
Rate. In other words the number of calories your body needs to function 
while at rest. 
You then multiply the BMR by an ‘activity variable' to obtain your TDEE 
(total daily energy expenditure). This Activity Factor is the cost of living 
and it is based on more than just your workouts. It also includes 
work/lifestyle, sport & the thermogenic effect of food, (essentially the 
amount of energy burned in the process of digesting food). 
Average activity variables are as follows: 
1.2 = Sedentary - Little or no exercise + desk job 
1.3-1.4 = Lightly Active - Little daily activity & light exercise 1-3 days a 
week 
1.5-1.6 = Moderately Active - Moderately active daily life & Moderate 
exercise 3-5 days a week 

================================================================================
1.7-1.8 = Very Active - Physically demanding lifestyle & Hard exercise or 
sports 6-7 days a week 
1.9-2.0 = Extremely Active - Hard daily exercise or sports and physical job 
This number you have now calculated is the number of calories you need 
to consume to maintain your current weight. 
If your goal is to lose weight, subtract 500 calories from this number and 
consume the specified amount of calories on a daily basis. 
If your goal is to gain lean mass add 500 calories to this number and 
consume the specified amount of calories on a daily basis. 
For a more in depth explanation of the principles and guidelines of 
Flexible Dieting and IIFYM consider reading the precursor to this book. 
‘Flexible Dieting 101: Eat the Foods you Love and Achieve the Body of 
Your Dreams’ 
Now that you have obtained your magic caloric number from the formula 
above let’s step into the kitchen and create some great meals to help you 
reach your caloric goal!

From here on in you will find 160 of my favorite flexible dieting recipes, 
each recipe is categorized under a heading as to the most appropriate use 
or time to consume the particular meal. 
Each recipe states the number of servings, as well as the calorie and 
macronutrient breakdown on a per serving basis. 
Please note that these macronutrients and calories listed with each recipe 
; 
are calculated using the exact ingredients in the recipe, If you wish to

French Toast 
Serves: 3 
Preparation time: 5 minutes 
Cooking time: 5 minutes 
Ingredients: 
6 slices Sara lee Delightful Whole Wheat and Honey 45 calorie bread 
250g Egg Whites 
% cup (125m!) unsweetened Almond Milk 
2 packets sweetener or Stevia 
% tsp (2ml) Baking Powder/Baking Soda 
Method: 
Preheat a pancake griddle at a medium heat 
Combine the egg whites, almond milk, baking powder, and sweetener ina 
shallow dish 
Using two forks, place each slice of bread in the egg mixture, turning over 
to saturate both sides. 
Place each slice on the griddle and cook until a golden color is achieved, 
turn and repeat. 
Top with your favorite syrup or jam, but remember to adjust the macros! 
Tips: 
Use a medium high heat if you desire a more moist toast, as the outside 
will be done prior to drying out the inside. 
41 

================================================================================
Also for a more moist toast, decrease the amount of egg whites and/or 
increase the amount of almond milk. Vice versa for a crispier toast. The 
amount of necessary egg whites may vary by the bread you use. The Sara 
Lee bread absorbs liquid like a sponge!

INTRODUCTION
Enrolling to study nutrition at the University of 
Roehampton was a life-changing decision for me.  
It was one that, in part, I was driven to from 
firsthand experience of how easily we can fall into 
dysfunctional relationships with food, how pressures 
to look a certain way can lead to a pursuit of dietary 
quick fixes that are a world away from a relaxed and 
healthy enjoyment of food. 
At the age of 17, I was an aspiring soprano singer, 
thrust into the limelight having won Classic FM’s 
young musician of the year. Schooled at The Royal 
Academy of Music and singing on stage at the likes 
of the Royal Albert Hall and Paris Fashion Week,  
I appeared to be living the most thrilling life.  
But after four years suffering the pressures of the 
music industry, compounded by fueling myself  
with passing dietary fads, I looked at my career  
and thought, I don’t want this anymore. While  
a complete career change is rare, it is one of the  
best moves I ever made.
Following four grueling yet thrilling years,  
I obtained undergraduate and master’s degrees  
in nutrition and started a new life as a fledgling 
nutritionist. Having founded Rhitrition in 2016,  
a private Harley Street clinic, my specialist team  
and I now work with individuals and leading brands 
to support their health and well-being. Our ethos is 
simply that we believe in empowering everyone to 

================================================================================
embrace a healthy way of living through the food we 
enjoy and the life we lead. Our bodies are as unique 
as our personalities, so each of us should strive to 
find a way of eating that works for us individually.
It is through my experience in clinic that I have 
come to learn just how widespread pseudoscience is. 
It’s everywhere, from the labels in the supermarket, 
on the ads that pop up in your Instagram feed, and 
most of all in magazines—bold statements in jargon 
that give the false impression they’re supported by 
laboratory research. With this book, I’m betting on 
the opposite approach—cold, hard facts that will 
teach you and help shape the way you think about 
food like never before.
Covering every conceivable topic—from gut bacteria 
to weight management to heart health and immune 
support to vegan diets and intermittent fasting  
(and everything in between)—The Science of Nutrition 
offers clear answers with informative graphics, 
making it easy to understand. I know that in 
debunking popular myths and diets, this book will 
enable you to make informed decisions that are best 
suited to you, about what, when, and how to eat 
responsibly for health and happiness.

WHAT DO WE MEAN  
BY NUTRITION?
Nutrition is the process by which we provide the body with the  
nutrients necessary for good health and growth. Essentially,  
nutrition is nourishment for the body via the foods you eat.
Eating nutritiously enables you to enjoy the  
sense of well-being that comes with good health. 
Adequate nutrition is vital if you want your body  
to be healthy and well maintained and have the best 
chance at fighting disease and operating optimally. 
We get our nourishment mostly from 
macronutrients, which are the dietary main players, 
but micronutrients are no less important. A balanced 
diet contains many different types of both.
MACRONUTRIENTS
There are three macronutrients: carbohydrates  
(see pages 12–13), protein (see pages 14–15), and  
fat (see pages 16–17). These three macronutrients 
give your body the energy it needs to operate. 
The body takes care of many processes that 
require energy without our conscious control  
(such as breathing, temperature regulation, 
digestion, and cell repair). And, of course,  
your body requires energy for movement. Each  
of the macronutrients is required in relatively  
large amounts every day to support many of  
your body’s vital functions. 
MICRONUTRIENTS
We need vitamins and minerals, known as 
micronutrients, in much smaller quantities than 
macronutrients, but they are vital for the body to 
carry out its functions. In children, they are also 
essential for healthy growth and development. 
Because we need macronutrients in much larger 
quantities than micronutrients, it’s easy to 
underestimate the importance of the latter and  
focus more on including the former in the diet.  
But the absence of micronutrients can lead to severe 
consequences. The World Health Organization 
suggests that micronutrient deficiency is responsible 
for some of the most common nutritional deficiencies, 
such as anemia (iron), rickets, and osteoporosis 
(vitamin D), all of which can have a debilitating 
effect on the body’s well-being and performance.
You can get most of your vitamins and minerals 
from plants. Plant foods come in various colors and 
shades, and their color is linked to the nutrients they 
contain. For instance, orange often indicates the 
presence of vitamin A; purples indicate antioxidants; 
greens contain vitamin K and iron; and red 
vegetables contain lots of vitamin C. So a colorful 
diet will give you a well-varied nutrient intake.
The daily requirement of each micronutrient 
varies between individuals, but if your diet is healthy 
and balanced, including foods from both plants and 
animal sources, you are likely to be ingesting all the 
micronutrients your body needs without the need  
for supplements. For those who don’t eat animal 
products, a well-thought-through diet alongside 
targeted supplementation will provide the essential 
nutrients you need (see pages 128–131). However, do 
see a registered dietitian nutritionist if you want to 
enhance your diet for optimal performance.

================================================================================
WHAT IS NUTRITION? 11
Unique nutritional needs
THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL IN NUTRITION. 
Your optimal intake of each macronutrient and 
micronutrient depends on numerous factors. Your age, 
gender, genetics, metabolism, level of physical activity, 
and personal preferences all have a part to play in 
establishing the best foods to keep working optimally. 
Learn to listen to your body and notice how you feel  
in response to your diet. See your primary care 
physician if at all concerned.

FOR THE BODY AND 
ALSO PROVIDE FIBER 
FOR HEALTHY  
DIGESTION

================================================================================
12
WHAT ARE CARBOHYDRATES?
Carbohydrates are the body’s greatest energy source. They provide the body with 
glucose to use for energy, which can also be stored (as glycogen) for future use. Carbs 
also play a valuable role in gut health, by providing useful fiber to the digestive tract.
Glucose is the preferred energy source for muscles 
during strenuous exercise. It is only when the  
body’s glucose supply is depleted that it turns to  
fat for energy. The body also requires glucose to  
fuel multiple unconscious biological processes. 
Glucose is essential fuel for the brain, aiding  
in concentration. Carbohydrates play an important  
role in generating the brain’s serotonin supply.  
This mood-regulating hormone is made with 
tryptophan, an amino acid (see page 15) obtained 
through protein in the diet. Carbs help convert 
tryptophan into serotonin, so eating carbs may  
help enhance mood. This might explain why carbs 
and sweet foods are often treated as comfort foods. 
There isn’t enough research to show that 
consuming higher quantities of carbs or protein-rich 
foods containing tryptophan supports mood 
improvement in humans. However, it may be the  
case that low-carb consumption causes low mood. 
If you’ve ever been on a diet that involves avoiding 
carbs, you may have experienced mood swings and 
found it hard to concentrate. You may have also felt 
fatigued. Serotonin is converted to melatonin, a 
hormone that helps regulate circadian rhythm. 
DIGESTING CARBS
In the small intestine (see page 28), the less starchy 
complex carbs are broken down into simple carbs 
(see below). All non-glucose monosaccharides are 
converted into glucose in the liver, which is released 
Monosaccharides

"saccharide" means 
"sugar." These are carbs  
in their most basic form.

complex carbs
Monosaccharides (sugar 
in its simplest molecular 
form) and disaccharides 
are simple carbohydrates. 
Complex carbs comprise 
many monosaccharides 
and also contain starch  
in varying levels. Less 
starchy complex carbs 
include broccoli,  
zucchini, tomato, and 
eggplant. Examples of 
starchier complex carbs 
are potatoes, beans,  
and corn.
many vegetables,  
beans, lentils,  
and whole grains

WHAT IS NUTRITION? 13
into the bloodstream. It is either used immediately 
or converted into glycogen (a polysaccharide of 
glucose), which is stored in the liver and muscles  
for later use (see pages 110–111). 
Fiber (see pages 18–19) refers to any complex 
carbohydrates that cannot be broken down by  
the digestive enzymes in the small intestine  
(see pages 28–29). This fibrous matter moves into  
the large intestine, where it helps produce highly 
useful short-chain fatty acids and nourishes the 
lining of the gut.
"GOOD" AND "BAD" CARBS
There is no such thing as an inherently good or  
bad carb. All foods have a place—it’s about finding 
the right balance for your own body. As a general 
rule, carbohydrates in their natural, fiber-rich form 
are more nutritious than those that have been 
stripped of their fiber content. Fruits and vegetables 
are excellent sources of carbohydrates. 
There’s a strong case for reducing refined carbs, 
like white bread, and opting for complex carbs, like 
whole grains (see p.45), which release energy slowly. 
While refined carbs are great for providing energy 
quickly, they usually lack essential nutrients. Many 
grain-based processed foods in the US are fortified 
or enriched with vitamins and minerals. 
Rice cakes Many people 
presume these popular low-
calorie snacks are healthy  
when, in fact, they are also  
low in nutrients.
What does GI mean?
GLUCOSE FROM SIMPLE CARBS IS ABSORBED 
INTO THE BLOODSTREAM QUICKLY, WHILE 
COMPLEX CARBS TAKE LONGER TO BREAK DOWN.
Glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly  
a carbohydrate food will make your blood glucose 
levels rise after ingesting it. The higher the GI, the 
faster the impact. Glycemic load (GL) is a slightly 
different unit of measurement. It takes into 
account both the GI and the amount of 
carbohydrate in the food. So pasta has a lower GI 
than watermelon, yet pasta has more carbs and, 
therefore, a higher GL. If you eat similar amounts  
of both, the pasta will have the greater effect  
on your blood sugar levels.

WHAT IS NUTRITION? 15
WHAT IS PROTEIN?
The macronutrient protein is a major player in the diet. It is the body’s building  
block, used to form and repair muscles, skin, hair, and nails, for instance.  
Protein also enables many of the body’s vital metabolic functions.
Every single cell in the body contains protein, and 
there are thousands of types found in the body. 
Proteins form the structure of tissues. They also 
carry molecules around the body to where they are 
needed, playing an important role in many chemical 
reactions that take place, including immune response 
and the production and deployment of hormones.
Proteins are made up of amino acids. Short chains 
of amino acids are called peptides (they connect to 
each other with peptide bonds) while longer chains 
are called polypeptides or proteins. Protein chains 
can become complex in structure as more and more 
chains join and fold in on themselves. The body 
breaks down protein chains into peptides to use  
for specific purposes as required. For instance, the 
hormone insulin (see pages 172–173) is a peptide. 
The body can produce many of the amino acids  
it needs to make peptides and proteins, but nine  
of them, known as essential amino acids, must be 
sourced from the diet (see opposite). Because the 
body doesn’t store proteins in the same way it does 
other macronutrients, it needs to consume proteins 
every day. Numerous studies demonstrate that a  
diet with adequate protein has major health benefits.
FOOD SOURCES
Food sources containing all nine essential amino 
acids in sufficient quantities are known as complete 
proteins. They are found in animal products and a 
few plant sources. 
Incomplete proteins are plant-based sources of 
protein that don’t contain all nine essential amino 
acids, or don’t have sufficient quantities of them  
to meet the body’s daily requirements. Although 
“incomplete,” they are no less valuable than complete 
proteins as protein needs are met across the whole 
day, not just at each individual meal.
Vegans and vegetarians are advised to eat a wide 
variety of protein-rich and fortified foods to ensure 
they consume all nine of the essential amino acids 
each day from both complete and incomplete sources 
(see pages 128–129).
PROTEIN INTAKE
Scientists agree that age, gender, and level of 
physical activity all determine how much protein to 
consume. In the US, adults are advised to consume 
0.8g protein per kg (2lb) of bodyweight per day. 
(Particularly active people should increase this intake 
to 1g.) Based on average weights and activity levels, 
daily intake should be 56g for men and 46g for 
women. That’s about two palm-size portions of meat, 
fish, tofu, nuts, or beans. Elderly people need up to 
50 percent more than the recommended daily intake. 
As we grow older, our bodies become less efficient at 
using protein. Increasing protein intake makes it 
more likely we’ll meet daily requirements.
I advise my clients to get as many complete 
protein sources in as possible throughout the day 
and/or focus on consuming a wide variety of 
incomplete sources.
When choosing what protein to eat, ensure the 
foods you pick give you the best all-around nutrition 
possible. Consider what other nutrients you are 
receiving with your protein sources. 
And don’t worry about getting everything in at 
one sitting—your protein input can add up 
throughout the day. 

================================================================================

WHAT IS FAT?
Fat is a macronutrient found in many food sources. Consuming fats is vital  
to the body’s function, including processes such as brain activity, hormone 
production, and the body’s absorption of other nutrients from the diet.
We should aim to get one-third of our calories  
from fat. The fat we eat is broken down into 
triglycerides (fatty acid cells combined with  
glycerol, a type of glucose) that travel in the  
blood to wherever they will be used or stored. 
There are two main types of dietary fats:  
saturated and unsaturated. Unsaturated fats  
are either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. 
Most foods containing fat naturally contain a 
mixture of different types of fats, so it’s difficult 
to exclude one type in favor of another. However,  
we should aim to cut down on saturated fats  
and opt for more monounsaturated and 
polyunsaturated fats. 
Avoid the artificial additive transfat  
(see pages 58–59) due to its links to inflammation, 
unhealthy cholesterol levels, impaired artery 
function, insulin resistance (see page 172).
MONOUNSATURATED FATS
This type of unsaturated fat contains only  
one double bond in its molecular structure. 
Monounsaturated fats are linked to several  
health benefits, including a reduced risk of  
serious diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. 
Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are 
typically liquid at room temperature and are  
fairly stable for cooking purposes (see pages 66–67). 
The most common MUFA is oleic acid, which is  
present in olive oil in high amounts. Excellent 
sources of this healthy fat are avocados, nuts,  
seeds, canola oil, fish oils, and nut oils. 
POLYUNSATURATED FATS
This type of unsaturated fat contains two or more 
double bonds in its structure. Polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (PUFAs) are found in sunflower seeds, oily 
fish, walnuts, flaxseeds, and vegetable oils, including 
safflower, sunflower, and corn oils. 
Omega-3 and omega-6 are polyunsaturated fats. 
Omega-3 plays a crucial role in the production of 
hormones, in the immune system, blood clotting,  
and cellular growth. Studies show that consuming 
omega-3 fats is linked to reduced incidence of  
health conditions, including neurodegenerative 
disease, heart disease, and diabetes. We need to 
consider increasing our intake of omega-3 fats,  
as these are usually eaten in small quantities and 
found in less commonly consumed foods, like oily 
fish, flaxseeds, or walnuts. 
SATURATED FATS
These come mainly from animal sources and tend  
to be solid at room temperature. Saturated fats are 
very stable at high temperatures and therefore less 
likely to be damaged during cooking. That’s why, for 
instance, butter is used traditionally for baking cakes. 
Milk, cheese, fatty meats such as lamb, processed 
meat (sausages, burgers, and bacon), coconut oil, 
cakes, and cookies are sources of saturated fats. 
While saturated fat plays a part in nutrition, too 
much in the diet is linked to heart disease. We still 
eat too much saturated fat in the US. No more than 
5–6 percent of our total intake of calories should 
come from saturated fats.

Olive oil increases  
HDL levels in healthy 
people, the elderly,  
and those with high 
LDL cholesterol.
Avocados contain 
monounsaturated  
fatty acids and fiber, 
both of which lower  
LDL cholesterol.
Purple fruits and 
vegetables are rich in 
anthocyanins, which 
may help increase HDL 
cholesterol levels.
Oily fish 1–2  
times a week may  
help increase HDL 
cholesterol levels and 
benefit heart health.
Whole grains are 
linked to a lower risk of 
heart disease. Oats and 
barley contain beta- 
glucan, which lowers 
LDL cholesterol.
Nuts are rich in 
cholesterol-lowering 
fats and fiber, as well 
as minerals that are 
linked to improved 
heart health.
Legumes such  
as beans, peas, and 
lentils help lower LDL 
levels and are a good 
source of plant-based 
proteins.
Increasing HDL and reducing LDL cholesterol
We want to aim for a preferential ratio between HDL and 
LDL cholesterol. There are measures we can take to increase 
our HDL cholesterol levels and lower LDL. Nondietary 
actions include exercising regularly and stopping smoking. 
Avoid transfats completely, and include the following foods 
regularly in your diet.
Cholesterol is a lipid (fatty 
substance) the body uses to build 
cells, among other things. Some 
cholesterol is obtained from diet, 
but much of the body’s supply is 
made in the liver. It attaches to a 
protein to form tiny spheres 
(lipoproteins) that are carried in 
blood to wherever they are needed. 
There are two types: HDL and LDL.
High-density lipoproteins 
(HDL) are good cholesterol. 
These particles contain a high 
proportion of protein to 
cholesterol. They protect the 
body by carrying LDL cholesterol 
away from arteries to the  
liver, and they have anti-
inflammatory properties.
Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are bad 
cholesterol. They have a lower proportion 
of protein to cholesterol. These types of 
fatty acids carry cholesterol to the cells. 
Too much LDL can be harmful because it 
sticks to the inside walls of your arteries, 
causing buildup of fatty material,  
limiting blood flow and leading to  
heart conditions and stroke.

WHAT IS FIBER?
Fiber is in part made of long chains of glucose molecules (polysaccharides, see pages 
12–13). The small intestine is unable to break down the fiber content of carbs we 
consume. Fiber’s passage through the digestive system is very beneficial for health.
Fiber keeps the digestive system healthy and  
in good working order. It slows down digestion, 
which regulates blood sugar levels, and helps  
us feel fuller longer, reducing the likelihood  
of weight gain. Most people don’t eat enough  
of it, despite the positive health outcomes 
associated with consuming more of it. For each  
8g increase in daily intake, we reduce the risk of 
type 2 diabetes by 15 percent, heart disease by 
19 percent, and colon cancer by 80 percent. 
SOLUBLE FIBER
This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a 
gel-like substance that helps make stools soft. 
This enables them to progress through the gut 
with ease, preventing constipation. Soluble fiber 
(in oats, for instance) slows down digestion, 
which helps with satiety (see page 104) and also 
with regulating blood sugar levels. Soluble fiber 
has another great benefit; in the small intestine, its 
presence reduces the absorption of cholesterol into 
the bloodstream, which has the positive effect of 
reducing the levels of LDL cholesterol (the bad  
type of cholesterol; p.17) circulating in the blood.
INSOLUBLE FIBER
As the name suggests, insoluble fiber does not 
dissolve in water, so it can be only partially broken 
down by digestion. It helps to push things along in 
your digestive tract, preventing digestive problems. 
Consuming enough insoluble fiber promotes 
regularity of bowel movements and helps  
regulate blood sugar levels.
RESISTANT STARCH

beta-glucose monomers (see right), such as cellulose, 
are referred to as resistant starches because they

FIBER
Polysaccharides like cellulose (found  
in plants) are made with beta-glucose 
monomers. The bond angles that form  
when these units of glucose join build into 
stable parallel chains that are strongly 
interlinked. There are no enzymes in the 
small intestine that are able to break  
down these beta-bonds.
STARCH
Polysaccharides like amylopectin (found in 
rice, potato, white bread and pasta, wheat, 
and barley) are made with alpha-glucose 
monomers. The bond angles formed when 
alpha-glucose momomers join builds a 
branched and/or spiral structure. These 
bonds can be broken down by enzymes in 
the digestive system
ALPHA-GLUCOSE 
MONOMERS
BETA-GLUCOSE 
MONOMERS
cannot be broken down by the small intestine.  
They pass into the large intestine, where they are 
fermented by gut bacteria. 
This fermentation process produces short-chain 
fatty acids (SCFAs), which stimulate the immune 
system and can impact mental health.
Cooked and cooled potatoes and rice contain 
resistant starch, which is also found in whole grains 
like barley, oats, and sorghum, green bananas, and 
beans and legumes.
INCLUDING ENOUGH FIBER
Our average daily fiber intake is 10–15g, and  
we should aim for 28g. A food high in fiber is 
considered to have 5g fiber per serving. 
Aim to include a mix of different sources of fiber.  
To ensure you get enough, include lots of whole  
grains, vegetables, fruits, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds 
in your diet. aim for as wide a variety as possible.
Foods may contain a mixture of types of fiber.  
For instance, whole grain products are good  
sources of both insoluble fiber and resistant starch. 
Consuming a diet that includes fiber from whole 
grains may reduce your risk of developing heart 
disease, diabetes, and several types of cancers. 
Bear in mind that suddenly increasing fiber can 
cause problems, such as bloating and loose bowel 
movements. Increase levels of fiber gradually and,  
if necessary, under the supervision of a doctor, 
dietitian, or nutritionist.
Cooked and cooled
COOLED COOKED WHITE RICE, POTATOES,  
SWEET POTATOES, OR PASTA PROVIDE MORE 
RESISTANT STARCH THAN IF CONSUMED HOT.
Even if you reheat them later, the resistant  
starch content (see left) remains increased.  
So enjoy potato, pasta, and rice salads, and cook  
up extra batches to refrigerate and reheat  
for tomorrow’s lunch or dinner. Care should be taken 
when storing cooked rice, which can contain 
bacterial spores that cause food poisoning.  These 
spores flourish when rice is left to stand at room 
temperature, so cool and refrigerate rice within an 
hour of cooking, refrigerate for no longer than a day, 
and reheat until piping hot before consuming.
Starch and fiber
These are often confused, and 
easily so, since both are contained 
together in the same foods, and 
both are carbohydrates, made up 
of polysaccharides. But in starch, 
chains of glucose monomers 
(monosaccharides, see p.12)  
are joined by alpha bonds, which 
can be broken down in the small 
intestine. In fiber, glucose 
monomers are joined by beta 
bonds, which can’t be broken 
down. Instead the chains remain 
intact throughout their passage 
through the small intestine.

WHAT ARE VITAMINS? 
Vitamins are nutrients we need to obtain from the foods we eat in order to ensure 
optimal health and prevent nutritional deficiencies. Aim to include a colorful variety 
of veggies and fruits in your diet to pack in all the vitamins you need.
Our bodies cannot make all the micronutrients  
(see page 10) we need to function, so this 
requirement is met solely by diet. Most people 
enjoying a healthy, balanced diet will easily obtain 
enough vitamins. If you don’t eat animal products, 
though, there are measures you can take to prevent 
potential nutritional deficiencies (see pp.130–131).
Vitamins come in two main forms, water-soluble 
and fat-soluble. 
WATER SOLUBLE
Water-soluble vitamins are easily lost through bodily 
fluids (and in cooking) and must be replaced each day.
  B vitamins play an important role in keeping  
the nervous system healthy and helping  
our bodies release energy from the foods we eat. 
Folate (vitamin B9) helps with brain and spinal  
cord development in unborn babies (see page 178).  
Sources of B vitamins are:
  B1  Peas, bananas, nuts, whole grains
  B2  Milk, eggs, fortified cereals, mushrooms
  B3  Meat, fish, wheat flour, eggs
  B5  Chicken, beef, eggs, avocado
  B6  Pork, soybeans, peanuts, oats, bananas, milk
  B7  is needed in trace quantities, and is available 
from many food sources, so will be present in a 
varied and balanced diet
  B9  Leafy greens, chickpeas, edamame beans, 
broccoli, liver, foods fortified with folate
  B12  is found only in animal products, such  
as eggs, meat, or fish, or in fortified plant foods,  
such as some nutritional yeast products. If you  
are vegan, I highly advise reviewing whether you 
are getting enough B12.
  Vitamin C is often hailed as the cure to colds  
and flu because it contributes to healing. It also 
maintains healthy skin, blood vessels, and cartilage, 
and plays a role in the production of collagen, which 
maintains our skin’s elasticity and strength. Sources 
include oranges, peppers, broccoli, bananas.
FAT SOLUBLE
Fat-soluble vitamins tend to accumulate within the 
body so are not needed in the diet on a daily basis.
  Vitamins A and E are powerful antioxidants, 
helping to protect cells from free radicals and  
aging. Vitamin A contributes to cell renewal and 
repair, but note that excesses during pregnancy  
may harm the baby (see page 183). Vitamin E 
reduces the effects of skin aging and the risk of  
skin cancer. Sources of vitamin A include carrots 
and sweet potatoes. Sources of vitamin E include 
almonds and avocados.
  Vitamin D is unique because it is a hormone that 
we can produce in our own bodies with exposure to 
sunlight. This means we don’t need to get it from 
diet if there is enough exposure. However, with the 
use of sunscreen and the lack of sunlight in parts of 
the US and during winter, we are advised to 
supplement with vitamin D if our blood levels are 
low (see pages 138–139). Dietary sources include 
egg yolks, oily fish, fortified foods.
  Vitamin K is important for wound healing  
(we need it for blood clotting), and some evidence 
links it to bone health. Sources include green leafy 
vegetables, some cereal grains, and vegetable oil.

================================================================================
22
WHAT ARE MINERALS? 
Our bodies need certain minerals to function well. Many foods contain  
both vitamins and minerals, so a varied diet will help you meet  
your mineral requirements.
Unlike vitamins, which are organic compounds  
(made by plants or animals), minerals are inorganic 
chemical elements that come from soil, rock, or 
water. They are absorbed from the environment by 
plants as they grow, and by animals that eat those 
plants. There are many minerals, each with benefits. 
Try to include each type in your diet regularly. You 
need some minerals in greater quantities, such as 
calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorous, 
potassium, sodium. Others, like iodine, iron, 
selenium, and zinc are needed in trace quantities.
  Calcium is a vital component of bone and teeth, 
and a key nutrient for the nervous system, muscles, 
and heart. Sources include milk, yogurt, spinach.
  Iodine deficiency affects nearly one-third of  
the world’s population. This mineral is essential  
for normal thyroid function and the production  
of thyroid hormones, which are involved in many 
processes in the body such as growth, brain

development, and bone maintenance. Thyroid 
hormones also regulate the metabolic rate.  
Sources include fish, dairy products, eggs,  
seaweed.
  Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional 
deficiency in the world and the only one that is 
prevalent in developed countries. More than 30 
percent of the world’s population has anemia.  
Lack of iron lowers the ability of the blood to  
carry oxygen. Iron has many benefits, including 
improved immune and brain function. Sources 
include shellfish, broccoli, red meat, tofu.
  Magnesium plays a role in more than 600 cellular 
processes, including energy production, nervous 
system function, and muscle contraction. Sources 
include avocados, nuts, leafy greens.
  Manganese helps make and activate some of the 
enzymes in the body that carry out chemical reactions 
such as breaking down food. Sources include bread, 
nuts, breakfast cereals, green vegetables.
  Potassium is important for blood pressure 
control, fluid balance, and muscles and nerve 
function. Sources include bananas, spinach, 
potatoes, apricots.
  Phosphorus helps the body build strong bones 
and also release energy from food. Sources include 
red meat, dairy, fish, poultry, oats, bread.
  Selenium helps the immune system work 
correctly, prevents damage to cells and tissues,  
and promotes the health of the reproductive system. 
Sources include Brazil nuts, eggs, meat, fish.
  Zinc supports the immune system, hormone 
production, and fertility. It can help reduce skin 
inflammation and support wound healing and 
protects against UV damage from the sun.  
Sources include shellfish, red meat, eggs, chickpeas.
SHOULD I TAKE SUPPLEMENTS?
Food is the preferable way for the body to source 
nutrients, which are often better absorbed from foods 
than pills. It’s possible for supplements to interact in 
ways that affect one another, or to contain one or more 
of the same nutrients, potentially leading to toxic 
buildups. Generally, water-soluble vitamins are less 
likely to cause harm than fat-soluble since they are 
excreted easily in your urine and have less chance of 
building up in the body. Yet be cautious. Too much 
vitamin C or zinc (a water-soluble mineral) may cause 
nausea, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Too much 
selenium could lead to hair loss, gastrointestinal upset, 
fatigue, and mild nerve damage. 
As the consequences of taking supplements can  
be serious, and supplements can be costly, it’s not 
worth taking supplements unless advised to do so  
by a health care professional. 
There are sometimes valid reasons for taking 
supplements, for instance, during preconception  
and pregnancy (see pages 178–181). Also, iron or 
vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia. If you 
believe you have a nutritional deficiency, speak  
to your doctor. Blood tests can help diagnose 
deficiencies, and supplements can then be  
prescribed to help correct them.

================================================================================

IS HYDRATION  
PART OF NUTRITION?
Hydration is an incredibly important part of nutrition. Water is  
essential for all of the body’s processes to work. In fact, we would  
survive a good deal longer without food than without water.
It is not easy to find even one system of the 
body that does not require water. Water enables 
the circulatory system to carry essential oxygen 
and nutrients to cells. Our kidneys need water 
to filter out waste products (see right). It helps 
us cool off via sweat when we are too hot. It 
helps the digestive system do its job. And the 
list goes on!
When it comes to the brain, 75 percent of its 
mass is water, so alongside the bodily processes, 
hydration also plays a crucial role in regulating 
mood, productivity, and concentration.
Your body uses a lot of water each day. You 
need to drink enough water to replace what 
is lost so the body continues to function 
well and you feel your best. So, drink up!
DAILY TARGETS
According to guidelines, most of us 
should aim to drink 2.7 –3.7 liters of  
water every day. A typical mug or glass  
has a capacity of 7oz (200ml), so you’d  
need to have 11.5–15.5 drinks a day. Bear in 
mind that these are the recommended daily 
intake amounts and some people may need 
more. Aim for 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) daily if  
you easily get to 11.5 cups (2.7 liters). Get 
yourself a BPA-free reusable water bottle  
to help you keep track of your water intake.
Children and infants require less fluids  
than adults. Introduce tap water from the  
age of 6 months. With children, aim for  
7–10 glasses a day.
Make adjustments to these targets based on 
your lifestyle. If you sweat a lot (say, if you’re 
very active) you need to replenish that lost water 
frequently. On vacation in a hot climate, you 
may sweat more than usual and need to increase 
your water intake. Also, if you’re breastfeeding, 
you require a lot of additional fluid. As we age, 
hydration is still important. Elderly people often 
struggle to get enough hydration due to issues

with mobility and memory loss, for instance.  
It’s important to note that people with these 
issues can feel more comfortable day to day  
by drinking plenty of water.
WHAT TO DRINK
About 20 percent of our total fluid intake comes 
from the food we eat. When it comes to the rest, 
research suggests that many people prefer to 
take in fluids in the form of sugary drinks, tea, 
coffee, and juices. In one survey, 23 percent of 
responders claimed they chose carbonated 
beverages to stay hydrated. Although these 
drinks supply you with necessary fluids, you 
also end up adding caffeine, sugar, and 
sweeteners (and their negative health effects)  
to your body. The best way to hydrate is simply 
with water. In the US, tap water is safe to drink.
SIGNS OF DEHYDRATION
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, dark 
yellow urine (see above), feeling tired, thirsty, 
and dizzy, and urinating fewer than four times 
per day. Studies show that at about 1 percent 
dehydration (equivalent to 1 percent of body 
weight water loss) there are negative effects  
on mental and physical function, which become 
more severe as dehydration increases.
Regularly underhydrating often leads to 
constipation. If you find that you are 
constipated frequently, try increasing your  
fluid consumption (see page 155).

WHAT IS  
DIGESTION?
Digestion is the process by which our bodies absorb the nutrients needed to stay alive 
from the foods we consume. Nutrients are passed into the bloodstream to be taken to 
wherever in the body they are needed, and waste matter is formed and excreted.
The digestive system is around 30ft (9m) long in 
adults, and an awful lot is achieved along this length.  
Each section of it plays an important role. 
MOUTH
Food enters the mouth and is initially broken down 
by teeth as we chew it into smaller pieces. Digestive 
enzymes in saliva begin the process of chemically 
breaking down the food. The bolus (ball of masticated 
food) is swallowed and enters the esophagus.
ESOPHAGUS
At the back of the throat, behind the tongue, is the 
epiglottis, a flap of cartilage that covers the larynx 
(windpipe) as swallowed food passes it to enter the 
esophagus (food pipe). The esophagus is large 
muscular tube that extends from the epiglottis to 
the stomach. Its muscles move the bolus down the 
pipe to the stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter 
is a muscular ring acting as the stomach’s gateway. 
Acid reflux results if it doesn’t close properly.
STOMACH
The stomach releases digestive enzymes and acid that 
break down the food that enters. Gut muscles contract 
to churn the food, to help the chemicals break it up, 
and the acid kills off unwanted microbes in it. This 
process also informs the satiety hormone, leptin, to 
be released (p.105). (The corresponding hunger 
hormone, ghrelin, is released by the stomach when  
it is empty, to stimulate hunger pangs.) The stomach 
turns the food into chyme, which has a souplike 
consistency that the small intestine is able to process.
SMALL INTESTINE
The majority of nutrient absorption takes place  
in this 23ft (7m) long section of the digestive tract. 
It is covered with multiple tiny villi and microvilli 
that absorb nutrients from chyme through a process 
called diffusion (see pages 28–29) and pass them 
into the bloodstream. 
Food spends 2–6 hours in the small intestine, 
being broken down by digestive enzymes so 
diffusion can take place. Some of these enzymes  
are supplied by the pancreas, which also releases 
hormones to help regulate blood sugar levels as  
they rise in response to eating a meal (pp.30–31). 
The gallbladder also secretes bile into the small 
intestine to further aid in digestion.
The remaining material consists mostly of  
water, bacteria, dead cells from the gut lining,  
and indigestible fiber (see page 18). It moves  
along the small intestine to the ileocecal valve 
—the gateway to the large intestine.
LARGE INTESTINE
The large intestine plays a key role in finishing  
the job and creating feces. During the 12–30 hours  
it spends in here, the initially liquid mixture that 
arrives is turned into stools as its water content is 
slowly absorbed by the large intestine.
The majority of the trillions of microbes living in 
the gut are in the large intestine. These gut bacteria 
seem to play an important role in the synthesis of 
key nutrients. They also communicate with our 
immune cells and help prevent inflammation. They 
ferment the indigestible fiber in the large intestine,

which results in the release of valuable short-
chain fatty acids (p.18). Another product of 
these bacteria is gas (see p.154). Giving our gut 
microbes plenty of different types of fiber to 
feed on aids the digestive processes and helps 
support beneficial gut bacteria (pp.48–51).
RECTUM AND ANUS
The end product is semi-solid waste material 
known as feces. This is collected together in  
the rectum, which is located at the far end of  
the large intestine, just before the two anal 
sphincters at the exit. Contraction and 
relaxation of the anal muscles pushes the stool 
through the sphincters and out of the anus.

the health of your digestive system by the shape and

HOW DOES THE BODY

DURING DIGESTION?
Once nutrients have been unlocked from the foods we eat by digestion (see page 26), 
they must be transferred into the bloodstream in order for the body to be able to use 
them. This process takes place in the stomach and the large and small intestines.

The process by which nutrients are  
absorbed by the body is known as diffusion. 
The inner wall of the small intestine contains 
multiple tiny projections, called villi.  
These dramatically increase the surface  
area available for absorption to take place;  
the average small intestine has 2,690 sq ft 
(250 sq m) of surface area! 
Villi are themselves covered in microscopic 
projections, known as microvilli, and these 
are responsible for diffusion. Nutrient 
particles released in the small intestine pass 
through these fine projections into the villi.
Villi These tiny fingerlike projections of the  
wall of the small intestine greatly expand its 
surface area. Each houses blood and lymphatic 
vessels that transport the nutrients absorbed  
by the villi to other parts of the body.

of the intestinal 
wall (enterocyte)
Microvilli
Each villi contains a mini-network of 
lymphatic vessels (lacteals) and capillaries 
that essentially connect the intestine to the 
body’s circulatory and lymphatic systems. 
Proteins (broken down into amino acids) 
and carbohydrates (broken down into 
glucose) pass into the blood vessels. Fats 
(broken down into lipids) pass into the 
lymphatic vessels. 
These blood and lymphatic vessels then 
transport those nutrients to different parts 
of the body to be used as needed or stored 
for later use.

WHAT IS METABOLISM?
Metabolism is the term used to collectively refer to every single chemical reaction 
that takes place in your body in order to keep it alive. Metabolism is closely linked to 
nutrition, because the food we eat provides the energy required to fuel metabolism. 
On average, we use 10 percent of energy intake on 
digestion itself, 20 percent on physical activity, and  
a whopping 70 percent by organs and tissues to keep 
the body alive. Every process in the body, from 
breathing to thinking, uses energy. A person’s basal 
metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories 
needed to sustain their life while they are sitting still. 
How the body metabolizes the energy it consumes 
is played out in a balancing act between two states—
fed and fasted. 
FED (ABSORPTIVE) STATE
During or after eating a meal, food is broken down 
and glucose (see pages 12–13) is released into the 
blood for cells to absorb and use as fuel. When the 
body has obtained more glucose from food than is 
needed by cells, they stop absorbing it. The resulting 
increase in blood glucose levels triggers the release  
of insulin. Insulin stimulates liver and muscle cells 
to reverse the conversion of glycogen into glucose 
(see pages 110–111) that takes place during the 
fasted state (see opposite) and, instead, absorb the 
surplus glucose in the bloodstream, convert it to 
glycogen granules, and store it for future use.  
Insulin also triggers the conversion of glucose to 
triglycerides (fats) in adipose tissue. Surplus fatty 
acids from the diet are also stored in adipose tissue. 
How much energy gets stored in part depends on 
your BMR, which is influenced by factors such as 
genetics, age, sex, and body composition. To maintain 
a healthy and stable weight, we must (to simplify) put 
energy into the body that matches the energy expelled 
to stay alive, plus energy used in physical activity. If 
we consistently put in more calories than we burn, 
the excess is efficiently stored as fat. 
FASTED (POSTABSORPTIVE) STATE
Several hours after eating, blood glucose levels  
drop, which triggers the pancreas to release glucagon  
(see opposite). This stimulates the liver and adipose 
tissue to metabolize glycogen stores, which releases 
glucose into the bloodstream to make it available  
for the body to use as energy. 
After prolonged fasting, fat stores in adipose 
tissue are broken down into glycerol and fatty 
acids in the liver. Ketone bodies are a by-
product of this reaction (see page 170). 
Protein is used for fuel only as a last  
resort (see page 33). 
Pancreatic cells
The pancreatic islets, 
also referred to as the 
islets of Langerhans, 
are clusters of cells 
that secrete the 
hormones responsible 
for balancing 
metabolism. These 
hormones work to 
balance blood sugar 
levels as the body 
oscillates between the 
fed and fasted states.

WHAT ARE CALORIES?
This unit of measurement is used to estimate how 
much energy there is stored in the chemical bonds 
of the foods we eat. Outdated guidelines state the 
average man needs about 2,500kcal a day to maintain 
a healthy weight, and for women, it’s 2,000kcal. But 
these figures should be adjusted depending on 
factors such as age, size, and level of physical activity.  
Your body may not gain the full amount of energy 
that is released from foods. Foods full of fiber, like 
nuts, for instance, take more energy to digest, and 
you absorb the remaining energy. Also, two people 
may absorb different levels of nutrients from the 
same quantity of the same foods. Gut health and  
the length of the intestines play a role in how much 
energy your body is able to absorb from foods.
It’s important to remember that calories are not 
everything! A number definitely does not dictate 
how healthy you are or the quality of nutrition you 
consume. You could be in your body’s ideal calorie-
intake range by eating a chocolate brownie for 
breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but this won’t provide 
you with all the key macronutrients, micronutrients, 
and fiber you need to be healthy and happy.

insulin into the 
bloodstream.
The released glucose  
enters the bloodstream  
and is now available for  
use as energy. The resulting 
rise in blood sugar levels 
eventually stimulates 
pancreatic beta cells to 
release insulin.
As glucose in the  
bloodstream is depleted, 
blood sugar levels begin  
to fall, stimulating  
pancreatic alpha cells  
to release glucagon.
Glucagon helps to  
regulate blood sugar by 
stimulating the release 
 of glucose from stores in 
the liver and muscles.
The presence  
of insulin enables  
glucose to enter the  
body’s cells so that it  
can be used by  
them as energy.

AM I MALNOURISHED?
Malnutrition is not something to worry about if you are receiving  
adequate nutrition from your diet. Sadly, this isn’t the case for around  
42 million people who are food insecure.
Social causes of malnutrition include poverty and 
lack of knowledge about nutrition. Physical causes 
include chronic or acute illness. For instance, an 
estimated 65–75 percent of people with Crohn’s 
disease and up to 62 percent of those with ulcerative 
colitis are malnourished (see pages 164–165).  
Eating disorders may also be a cause (see page 210).
Malnutrition is most common in children and  
the elderly, and women are more impacted than men.  
As women have smaller musculature, they require  
25 percent less energy per day than men but the 
same quantities of nutrients so must prioritize 
nutrient-rich foods, which is expensive. Pregnancy 
and breastfeeding also increase nutrient requirements.
MALNUTRITION IN CHILDHOOD
Children with diseases and illness will often make  
up a large number of reported cases of childhood 
malnourishment. Food intolerances or allergies may 
prevent children from receiving adequate nutrition. 
Also, young children have small stomachs, so they 
need to eat more frequently than adults do in order 
to get in all the nutrients they need across the day. 
This can be difficult for parents to juggle, leading  
to malnourishment. Not growing or putting on 
weight as expected are key signs to look out for. 
It’s important to be mindful when discussing 
healthy weight with children. Even weighing 
children may be linked to future disordered 
relationships with food.
IDENTIFYING MALNUTRITION
Many people erroneously believe that only 
undereating causes malnutrition. In fact, the  
term refers to any severe imbalance of energy and 
nutrients in the body. This can describe a variety  
of malnutritional scenarios. Most obviously, the body 
may lack certain nutrients it needs to function in a 
healthy way. Toward the other end of the spectrum, 
energy intake (food) exceeds energy expenditure 
(physical activity). In the case of malnourishment 
due to obesity, the micronutrients needed for good 
health are often undersupplied due to a diet high in 
refined carbohydrates, snack foods, sugar, junk foods, 
and highly processed foods. Both undernutrition and 
overnutrition are forms of malnutrition, and both are 
detrimental to health.
According to the World Health Organization,  
1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, while  
462 million are underweight. 
Signs of malnutrition
BEING MALNOURISHED HAS A BIG IMPACT ON 
HEALTH AND LIFE QUALITY. SIGNS INCLUDE:
  increased incidence of illness  
and infection
  slower wound healing
  increased incidence of falls
  low mood
  reduced energy levels
  reduced muscle strength and  
muscle mass (see opposite)
  reduced quality of life
  reduced independence and ability  
to carry out daily activities
  deficiencies of multiple vital 
micronutrients (see pp.20–23).
If you have any concerns about malnutrition  
in you or a family member, see your doctor.

================================================================================
Muscle wasting 
If the amount of energy coming from the diet is 
inadequate for the body to perform basic functions, 
the body resorts to unlocking protein from muscles to 
use as energy. Over time, this reduces muscle mass, 
causing weakness and increasing the risk of injury.

Malnutrition in later life
UP TO ONE IN TWO ADULTS AGE 65 AND OLDER 
AND AS MANY AS 39 PERCENT OF OLDER ADULT 
PATIENTS MAY BE MALNOURISHED OR AT RISK.
In many cases, the overall energy intake  
is adequate, but there is too much fat, sugar,  
and salt in the diet and not enough fruit, 
vegetables, and oily fish, for instance. This may be 
due to entrenched habits, a reduced ability to cook, 
or increased pickiness; elderly people often lose  
their sense of smell and taste, which reduces 
appetite. Psychological factors, such as  
memory loss or dementia, can also contribute  
to reduced energy intake. A decline in 
gastrointestinal health means fewer nutrients  
are absorbed. Other physical issues, such as 
dysphagia (problems with swallowing) can  
limit energy intake.
PHYSICAL IMPACT
When malnourished, vitamin and mineral deficiencies 
are more likely, which can impact negatively on many 
bodily processes. This could eventually affect a 
person’s ability to undertake everyday tasks. 
In the case of extreme undereating, once the body 
has depleted its glycogen stores (see page 110), it then 
turns to fat and protein stores for sources of energy. 
Reduced fat stores can lead to hormonal disruption. 
Women may lose their periods, and men can lose their 
morning erection. Once fat stores are depleted, breaking 
down protein to release amino acids to use as energy is 
the body’s last resort. This leads to muscle wastage (see 
above). The mass of individual organs can also become 
depleted over time, affecting their function.
Malnutrition in childhood can stunt growth, lead to 
poor mental development, life-limiting behavioral 
abnormalities, and even life-threatening conditions.

WHAT CAN I LEARN FROM 
MEDITERRANEAN, NORDIC, 
AND JAPANESE DIETS?
Noncommunicable diseases are now the leading cause of death 
globally, but in some parts of the world, people seem to live longer 
and healthier lives, which may be partly due to how they eat.
The Mediterranean diet concept developed 
when health organizations identified a possible 
link between traditional ways of eating in olive-
growing areas like southern Italy and Greece 
and low levels of chronic disease among older 
people. The core focus is fresh, seasonal produce; 
plant-based eating; and healthy unsaturated fats, 
especially from olive oil. Vegetables, legumes 
(beans and lentils), whole grains, and nuts form 
the bulk of meals; moderate animal protein 
MEDITERRANEAN 
Olive oil is comprised of  
mainly unsaturated fats
NORDIC
Whole grain rye  
bread is high in fiber
comes from oily fish and poultry; and there is 
low intake of red meat, eggs, yogurt, and cheese.
The Nordic diet was developed in response 
to rising obesity rates and to encourage people 
in the region to eat locally produced, sustainable 
foods. Most calories come from plant-based 
foods, making it fiber rich. Sea and lake fish  
and lean game meats are key protein sources, 
and canola oil, which is high in healthier 
monounsaturated fat, is used for cooking.

================================================================================
HOW CAN WE EAT WELL? 37
JAPANESE 
Purple sweet potatoes 
contain antioxidants 
Japan has among the highest life expectancy and 
lowest obesity rates globally. Its diet generally 
emphasizes plant-based eating of leafy vegetables, 
soybean-based foods like tofu and miso, and grains 
like rice and noodles, with animal protein from fish 
and pork. The Okinawa prefecture is particularly 
well known for longevity; its traditional diet is 
broadly similar, although high-fiber root vegetables 
are staples rather than rice, and very small amounts  
of fish and pork are eaten—not beef, eggs, or dairy. 
ARE THESE DIETS HEALTHY?
Heart health: A variety of evidence suggests  
that the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of  
cardiovascular disease (CVD), meaning conditions 
affecting the heart or blood vessels. A landmark 
study found that the diet reduced both the number  
of heart attacks and strokes and all deaths from 
cardiovascular causes after five years. Research has 
linked Nordic eating to a reduction in major risk 
factors for CVD, including high blood pressure. 
Japan has lower rates of CVD than other developed 
countries; it may be that high consumption of 
soy-based foods and oily fish increases “good”  
HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, which 
helps clear other types of cholesterol from the blood.
Cancer and diabetes: Studies suggest that 
closely following a Mediterranean diet long term 
may reduce the onset of various cancers (including 
breast, prostate, and colorectal). It’s also been linked 
to improved control of blood glucose, which can help 
in managing type 2 diabetes. A strict Nordic diet has 
been associated with a lower risk of developing type 
2 diabetes, although further research is needed.
Cognitive health: Japan has low rates of age-
related diseases, although research hasn’t yet 
identified the precise role of its diets. Most evidence 
focuses on Mediterranean eating, which has been 
linked to a slower rate of decline in memory and 
cognitive ability; high levels of plant antioxidants 
may reduce inflammation associated with diseases 
like Alzheimer’s.

your daily eating, turn to pages 38–39. 
Sweet potatoes for life
OKINAWA, SOUTH OF MAINLAND JAPAN, HAS ONE 
OF THE WORLD’S LONGEST LIFE EXPECTANCIES, 
WITH A REPORTED 68 CENTENARIANS PER 
100,000 INHABITANTS IN 2019. 
While genetics, social habits, and exercise play a 
part, the islands’ traditional diet relies heavily on 
purple sweet potatoes. These are high in fiber and a 
source of nutrients, including vitamins A and C and 
potassium, as well as the antioxidant anthocyanin, 
which various studies indicate helps protect 
against illnesses, including cardiovascular disease. 
Okinawans are also said to eat 18 different foods, 
including seven vegetables and fruits, every day.

================================================================================

HOW CAN I EAT A MORE 
MEDITERRANEAN, NORDIC, 
OR JAPANESE DIET?
Making small but sustainable changes that work with your personal preferences and 
budget is often the most effective way to eat a healthier diet. So how can you apply 
some of the key features of Mediterranean, Nordic, and Japanese eating?
DO I NEED TO EAT SWEET POTATOES? 
Consuming purple sweet potatoes (or foods like 
seaweed or bitter melon, which are also featured in 
the Japanese diet) can provide positive nutritional 
benefits; however, it’s better to eat them as part of  
a varied diet. Also, foods like these may need to be 
imported, increasing their cost and environmental 
footprint. You can find similar benefits to purple 
sweet potatoes in locally grown foods. For example, 
berries and cabbage are high in fiber, and red 
cabbage, blueberries, and blackberries are more 
accessible, and sustainable, sources of anthocyanins.                                                    
IS CANOLA OR OLIVE OIL HEALTHIER? 
Olive oil has a superior reputation to canola oil 
because the Mediterranean diet is well researched. 
However, both contain monounsaturated fatty  
acids, known to be beneficial for heart health and 
cholesterol. Canola oil has less saturated fat and 
contains omegas 3, 6, and 9, which support brain, 
heart, and joint function, whereas olive oil, especially 
extra-virgin, is higher in antioxidant substances 
called polyphenols. Canola oil retains antioxidant 
properties and its neutral flavor at higher 
temperatures. Both oils are high in calories— 
around 120 calories per tablespoon for olive oil.
SHOULD I EAT MORE NUTS AND SEEDS?
Nuts and seeds are featured in both  
Mediterranean and Nordic eating; they are high  
in monounsaturated fat and protein and are sources  
of fiber and vitamins, making them a highly 
nutritious addition to a healthy and balanced diet. 
Their nutritional profile varies; for example, pecans 
are good for B vitamins and almonds for calcium, 
while Brazil, macadamia, and cashew nuts have a bit 
more saturated fat. Overall, they make a healthy 
snack or can be sprinkled on breakfast cereal or 
salad and vegetables. However, due to naturally high 
fat content, a palm-sized serving is one portion.  
Choose raw and unsalted varieties, if possible. 
KEEP IT VARIED
While evidence points to some diets being more 
protective of health, it’s not clear whether this is due 
to particular elements or the diet as a whole. This 
suggests there isn’t one “perfect” diet; variety and a 
balance of healthy foods is probably more important.

diet; it has to reflect your body’s energy needs and 
your lifestyle, beliefs, and preferences. The “balanced 
plate” concept is a useful guide to the types and 
proportions of foods you should try to consume at 
mealtimes; apply it when shopping, cooking, or 
eating out to help you eat a varied, nutritious  
range of food. 
It isn’t essential to achieve the balance of food 
groups outlined here at every meal; just aim for it 
over the course of your day or week. A healthy 
adult’s diet should contain carbohydrates, protein, 
and fat—in five key food groups. Hydration is also 
important; it helps you absorb nutrients and feel full. 
WHAT’S ON A BALANCED PLATE?
  Starchy carbohydrates like rice, pasta,  
potatoes, quinoa, and oats should form the base  
of the meal and about one-third of your daily  
intake. Choose higher-fiber whole grain versions  
of these foods wherever possible, with reduced  
or no salt or sugar.
WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES  
OF HEALTHY EATING?
There is so much information available and so many theories about the best  
way to eat well, you can easily end up feeling confused and frustrated. But the  
principles are simple—variety and balance on the plate.
A good day’s eating
Try to eat a range of foods 
from these groups daily 
and a small amount of 
high-fat, sugar, or salt  
foods only occasionally. 
Portion amounts shown

  Vegetables and fruits are just as important, 
if not more so; aim to eat at least five portions 
every day and exceed this wherever possible. 
Try to eat as wide a range as you can—this  
can include fresh, frozen, dried, and canned 
(in water or juice without salt or sugar). 
Include a higher ratio of vegetables to fruits 
and regularly change your combinations. 
   Protein-rich foods include pulses  
(such as kidney beans, lentils, and chickpeas), 
quinoa, soybean products like tofu and 
tempeh, nuts, eggs, fish, and meat. It’s best  
to limit the amount of red and processed meat  
(see pages 68–69).
  Dairy is a good source of many nutrients, 
including calcium and phosphorus; it includes  
hard and soft cheese, yogurt, and cow’s milk. 
  Unsaturated oils and fats like olive 
oil or canola oil should be used in small 
amounts for cooking or to enhance flavor.
VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS
The same broad principles apply,  
but eating a wide variety of protein  
sources is even more important because  
most plant-based protein is incomplete,  
meaning it lacks certain essential amino  
acids (see pages 128–129). 
Choose dairy alternatives like soy  
milk that are unsweetened and fortified 
with calcium, plus other sources of healthy  
omega-3 fatty acids like walnuts and ground 
flaxseed. Vegans may still need to supplement 
certain nutrients, such as vitamins D and B12,  
and iron (see pages 130–131).

SHOULD I EAT LESS MEAT  
AND MORE FISH?
Most adults choose meat over fish as their main source of protein, and most 
Americans eat less fish than recommended. But it’s worth adding more into your diet 
because whether it’s fresh, canned, or frozen, fish offers plenty of benefits.
A great source of protein, with less fat than many 
meats, fish and shellfish typically provide 15g–20g 
of protein per 100g, roughly a third of the daily 
recommended amount for many adults. 
Eating fish—especially oily types like sardines, 
salmon, trout, and mackerel—is also a good way to 
obtain beneficial amounts of the omega-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids EPA (eicosapentaenoic 
acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Oily fish is 
fattier than white fish and shellfish (some of which 
contain low levels of omega-3s), but it’s mostly 
healthy polyunsaturated fat. EPA and DHA are 
associated with improved cardiovascular and 
cognitive health; for example, research indicates  
that oily fish eaters have more gray matter—the 
brain’s major functional tissue linked to memory. 
Many people don’t eat enough omega-3s,  
which you can obtain only from diet. Some oily  
fish are also among the few dietary sources of 
Vitamin D (see pages 138–139).

Dietary patterns that include regular fish 
consumption, like the Mediterranean diet, are 
generally associated with a lower risk of becoming 
overweight and obese. In a US-based study of more 
than 40,000 men, those who consumed more than 
one portion of any fish every week had a 15 percent 
lower risk of developing heart disease. The 
recommended portion for seafood is 8–10oz per 
week for adults 19 and older, 2–10oz for those 2–18 
years old, and 2–3oz for children aged 6–23 months. 
US FDA and EPA guidelines suggest consuming 
seafood choices higher in EPA and DHA, such as 
salmon, anchovies, sardines, Pacific oysters, and 
trout, to limit mercury exposure.

fresh. Choose canned fish in water; brine contains  
a lot of salt, and omega-3s may seep into oil. Fish 
will absorb fats used during cooking, especially lean 
varieties. High-temperature methods can break 
down omega-3s—baking, grilling, and steaming  
will help preserve nutritional content. Sustainability 
is also a consideration (see pages 124–127).
WHAT ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS? 
While it’s not a substitute for fish within a balanced 
diet, fish oil can be beneficial for those who don’t  
eat fish. However, it can contain heavy metals, and  
as fish derive omega-3 by eating algae, it may be 
better to opt for algae oil. Krill oil is extracted from 
crustaceans and is rich in both EPA and DHA. Fish 
liver oil contains a high amount of vitamin A; this 
may be harmful during pregnancy, and research 
suggests long-term use can weaken bones.

WHY ARE LEGUMES AND  
PULSES SO GOOD FOR YOU? 
Legumes and pulses provide variety of both flavor to the palate and nutrition  
to the body. They are packed full of micronutrients and fiber, and pulses  
specifically offer an affordable way to add nonmeat protein to your diet.
A legume is the leaves, stem, pod, or seeds of any  
plant from the Fabaceae family. We tend to eat the 
seed pods (like green beans and sugar snap peas)  
or the seeds from within them (either fresh, like peas 
and fava beans, or dried, like “pulses”). Both contain 
zero saturated fat and contain valuable nutrients. 
There is strong evidence associating beans and 
lentils with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, 
obesity, diabetes, and cancer. They are loaded with 
prebiotics (see pages 52–53) as well as fiber (see 
pages 18–19). Clinical trials show improved health 
outcomes in people eating 25–29g of fiber daily. 
PULSES
The dried seeds of legumes are called pulses.  
They include lentils, chickpeas, black or pinto beans, 
soybeans, and kidney beans. These robust seeds 
contain varying amounts of the essential amino acids 
that make up protein (see pges 14–15). A 3.5oz 
(100g) serving of red lentils, chickpeas, or kidney 
beans provides 7.5g–8.5g of protein, which makes 
up a nice chunk of your daily requirement. You can 
save much money by getting more of your protein 
from beans rather than meat, adding lots of valuable 
fiber to your diet at the same time. Being starchy 
carbs (see pages 12–13), they typically contain 
around 8g fiber per 100g—that’s almost one-third of 
your daily requirement. 
LEGUMES
Eating leguminous vegetables like green beans  
is also important, because they contain other 
important nutrients. There is a lot of research to 
suggest we should aim to include more leguminous 
vegetables in our diet. Aim to include more green 
beans, butter beans, and soybeans in your diet.
LEGUMES 
CONTAIN PROTEIN,  
FIBER, FOLATE, 
PHOSPHOROUS, IRON,

Heart healthy Research shows that eating 
legumes roughly four times weekly is associated 
with a 14 percent reduced risk of coronary 
artery disease. Substituting plant proteins for 
red meat reduces the risk factors, such as blood 
cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure.

================================================================================
HOW CAN WE EAT WELL? 45
WHY ARE WHOLE GRAINS  
SO GOOD FOR YOU?
Humans across the globe consume plenty of cereal crops, such as barley, oats, rice, 
and wheat. It is the seed of these crops, known as the grain, that we eat. Whole grains 
are those left intact when prepared for use as an ingredient.
When they are being processed, refined 
carbohydrates have the bran and germ 
removed, which results in light flours for 
making white bread or fluffy cakes, or 
enables the production of white rice and 
white pasta. However, the bran and germ 
are valuable sources of fiber and nutrients. 
While refined carbs provide energy 
(see page 12), whole grains are 75 
percent more nutritious. 
Whole grains provide fiber, B 
vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, 
protein, as well as many antioxidants, 
micronutrients, and phytochemicals. 
Regular consumption is linked to gut 
and heart health and the prevention of 
cancers, diabetes, and obesity. Surveys  
show that 95 percent of adults  
don’t eat enough whole grains,  
and almost one in three  
adults get none at all. 
USING MORE WHOLE GRAINS
In many cases, you can swap out refined 
products for whole grain ones—substitute 
whole wheat bread for white bread, or 
brown rice for white rice. Try serving a 
curry with a new and whole grain, like 
buckwheat, spelt, or pot barley, for instance. 
Whole oats, for example, are also 
very nutritious. Try having oatmeal 
for breakfast more frequently, and 
choose granola bars for snacks.
From time to time, experiment 
with new whole grains to consider 
how you might add more types  
to your culinary repertoire. Some  
are sweeter, like farro. Some make great 
accompaniments to a main dish, like quinoa 
or bulgur. There’s tons of fantastic advice 
and inspiration on social media  
to help you get started with 
new flavors.

SHOULD I COOK MEALS FROM 
SCRATCH MORE OFTEN?
Cooking a meal using fresh, canned, or frozen ingredients can seem like a chore, 
especially when life is already busy. Is it worth the extra time and effort— 
and does it actually work out more expensive, as many people assume?
Preparing and cooking meals yourself can have  
real health benefits because you are in charge of 
how much sugar, fat, and salt goes into your meal  
(see pages 64, 66, and 70). Many highly processed 
foods, in particular ready-made meals and takeout, 
have added salt for flavor and preservation and are 
cooked in a significant amount of oil or butter,  
not to mention the addition of sugar to entice 
people into eating more of them (see pages 58–59).  
Cooking your own meals also means you can choose 
more nutrient-dense ingredients. For example, try 
using whole grains instead of refined carbohydrates, 
such as brown rice rather than white or whole wheat  
pasta or couscous (see pages 12–13).
How you cook matters
Potatoes are a rich source of micronutrients like potassium, 
vitamin B6, and vitamin C. How you prepare and cook them, 
like other ingredients, can significantly alter their nutritional 
content (shown per 3.5oz) and affect nutrient loss.

HOW CAN WE EAT WELL? 47
HOME COOKING AND HEALTH
A body of research supports the benefits of cooking 
from scratch. One 2017 study found that people who 
ate home-cooked meals more than five times a week 
were 28 percent less likely to have an overweight 
BMI (body mass index) score compared with people 
eating this way less than three times weekly. They 
also ate more fruits and vegetables. Research also 
suggests that cooking improves self-esteem and 
mood, although there are many factors to consider 
when isolating studies. Creating meals addresses 
different aspects of psychological well-being by 
providing a sense of autonomy and confidence and 
opportunities to socialize and build relationships.
COST-EFFECTIVE COOKING
Cooking with fresh ingredients like meat and fish 
can still work out cheaper than buying preprepared 
and takeout meals. Keep these simple tips in mind: 
  Use less meat and bulk up stews, soups,  
and curries with protein-rich canned beans,  
whole wheat pasta, and brown rice. 
  Divide your usual portion of meat into two  
meals, for instance, by adding grated carrot, 
zucchini, or chopped mushrooms. Loose  
vegetables are often less expensive. 
  Switch fresh fish for cheaper frozen or canned, 
ideally in plain water. Frozen fish has just as many, 
or even more, nutrients as fresh. This is true for 
many other ingredients.
  Shop with a friend to split bulk-buy discounts 
and bargains nearing sell-by dates. Separate large 
packs of meat or fish into portions and freeze ones 
you won’t cook before the use-by date.
  Before shopping, plan your meals and check 
which ingredients are already in your pantry.

We tend to associate bacteria with infection, but 
most bacteria in the gut are actually beneficial. 
Along with yeasts, fungi, and viruses, bacteria 
make up the gut microbiome—the ecosystem  
of around 100 trillion microorganisms mainly 
found in the colon. There are around 1,000 
species of gut bacteria; the specific combination 
is unique to each of us and changes over our life 
span. Research suggests maintaining a balance 
between more and less helpful bacteria is key  
to a healthy gut. 
In addition to digesting food, gut bacteria 
perform many other important tasks. For 
example, they help absorb minerals from food, 
synthesize vitamins like vitamin K (which helps 
with blood clotting), and digest dietary fiber, 
releasing molecules, including butyrate, which 
contributes to a stronger gut barrier, and 
propionate, which helps the liver regulate  
blood sugar levels and appetite. 
WIDER HEALTH
People with the inflammatory bowel conditions 
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have  
been found to have fewer species and a lower 
proportion of beneficial gut bacteria. Studies 
have also observed lower diversity in people  
with obesity, diabetes, and certain types of 
eczema and arthritis. Dysbiosis—an imbalance 
in the gut microbiome—has also been shown  
to contribute to metabolic syndrome, allergies, 
colorectal cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease. A 
healthy gut supports the immune system—
around 70 percent of immunity-related cells  
are located there. Friendly bacteria interact  
with the intestinal lining to prevent harmful 
molecules from leaking into the body and help 
activate new immune cells (see pages 136–137). 
HEALTHY GUT, HEALTHY MIND? 
We know the brain affects the gut because we 
often feel stress or excitement in our stomach, 
but diet could also have an impact on our brain. 
Scientists have only recently started exploring 
the mechanisms by which gut bacteria may 
influence the brain—and therefore how gut 
health could affect mood. Several studies have 
found the microbes of people with depression 
differ from others; in 2019, scientists identified 
two specific types of gut bacteria (Coprococcus 
and Dialister) that were consistently lacking in 
the microbiomes of the depressed subjects.
WHAT IS GOOD GUT HEALTH,  
AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
A healthy gut isn’t just necessary for good digestion. Scientists are uncovering  
more about all the ways the bacteria in your gut may be involved in your overall  
health—even your mental well-being.
Fermenting discomfort
FERMENTATION IS WHEN THE GUT BACTERIA 
BREAK DOWN DIETARY FIBER.   
This creates hydrogen and methane gas, which 
is normal and in fact shows that the gut is 
working effectively. However, those with a 
functional gut disorder like irritable bowel 
syndrome are more susceptible to the effects, 
due to increased sensitivity of their 
intestines—so they can feel bloating or 
abdominal pain.

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter 
mostly made in the gut to 
promote feelings of fullness and 
control appetite; it may also 
reach the brain via the blood and  
influence levels of happiness.
As a main communication 
highway between the brain and 
numerous organs, its functions 
include regulating heart rate, 
digestion, fighting inflammation, 
and relaxation.
The gut–brain axis
Scientists now know there  
is a constant two-way 
communication between the 
gut and brain that happens  
via different pathways—
including the vagus nerve, 
cells of the immune system, 
and chemicals released into 
the bloodstream.
Gut bacteria stimulate the 
production of specific cells that 
fight infection; it is thought that 
these could travel via the blood or

Fecal transplant
THIS PROCEDURE IS A FORM OF BACTERIOTHERAPY 
THAT USES A STOOL FROM A HEALTHY DONOR. 
It is placed in the colon of someone who is unwell in 
order to rebalance their gut bacteria. Although this is 
still a developing area, a 2016 review found its 
success rate varied from a third to three-quarters of 
cases in trials involving irritable bowel syndrome 
patients. While this is a developing area and research 
is ongoing, several studies indicate it may be an 
effective treatment for recurring C. difficile infections.
HOW CAN I INCREASE GUT 
MICROBIOME DIVERSITY?
The key to a healthy, functioning gut is the diversity of the bacteria living in it. 
Although our gut microbiome is established in infancy, as adults, we may still be  
able to boost our good gut bacteria through the foods we choose.
Our gut microbiome is shaped from birth to around 
three years old. Most microbes come from the 
mother’s birth canal during vaginal birth, or from 
the hospital environment in a Cesarean section, and 
also vary with breast or bottle feeding. Infants then 
acquire bacteria from their environment, nearby 
people, and diet. Once established, our lifestyle, 
stress levels, and diet can still cause shifts in our 
microbiome that may support or undermine health. 
For example, some strains from the Bifidobacteria 
and Lactobacillus families can prevent potentially 
harmful gut bacteria from getting out of control. 
DIVERSITY MATTERS 
Bacterial diversity is associated with how many 
unique plant species we eat, according to an 
international gut microbiome project analyzing data 
from thousands of volunteers. Researchers identified 
that eating 30-plus types of plants a week is linked 
to the production of various short-chain fatty acids; 
these help protect both gut health and immunity. 
Eating plenty of indigestible fiber has also been 
shown to boost the richness of the gut microbiome, 
while a low level in the diet reduces overall bacterial 
diversity. As well as many vegetables, whole grains 
like oats, brown rice, beans and lentils, and nuts and 
seeds are good fiber sources—US health guidelines 
advise healthy adults eat 28g of fiber on a 
2,000-calorie diet. Many have a “prebiotic” effect  
by feeding beneficial bacteria. Naturally fermented 
“probiotic” foods like kefir can also be helpful; for 
example, most species of Lactobacillus are found in 
fermented foods (see pages 52–53).
In contrast, several studies have found that a typical 
Western diet, which is high in animal protein and  
fat and low in fiber, led to a marked decrease in total 
numbers of bacteria and beneficial Bifidobacteria. 
Some have also noted that while a change in diet  
can rapidly alter microbiome balance, it takes a 
long-term change in eating habits to create 
significant shifts in bacterial diversity. 
 
MEDICATIONS
Overuse of medications, particularly antibiotics,  
can decrease the amount of good bacteria in the  
gut. In one study, more than a quarter of 900 
antibiotic medications tested were found to be 
potentially damaging to the growth of gut  
microbes. Probiotics can help increase good bacteria 
in the gut; the most evidence we have for their 
effectiveness is taking them after a course of 
antibiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

================================================================================
52
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE   
BETWEEN PRE- AND PROBIOTICS?
The concept of consuming a daily prebiotic or probiotic to keep your gut balanced and 
healthy is hugely popular—sales of probiotic supplements alone have been projected 
to hit $65 billion by 2024. But is it really that straightforward?
Probiotics are live strains of bacteria consumed to 
directly increase the population of “good” bacteria  
in the gut. Prebiotic foods feed existing gut bacteria 
so they can thrive and work effectively. 
Probiotics are found in several fermented foods 
and drinks—specially formulated probiotic drinks, 
yogurts, and supplements contain specific “friendly” 
bacterial strains, often from the Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacteria species. 
One concern around probiotic foods is how many 
microbes can survive the acidic conditions in the 
stomach in order to reach your colon intact and 
colonize there. Live strains will also be destroyed by 
heat-based processes like canning or pasteurizing. 
There are no clear guidelines on how much you  
need to eat to gain a benefit from probiotics. In  
the US, the probiotic supplement market is largely 
unregulated. Bacteria content of supplements  
is specified on the label as “CFU” (colony  
forming units).
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?
Research suggests probiotics are mainly of benefit 
when your gut microbiome is out of balance, for 
instance, to relieve diarrhea caused by infection  
or after a course of antibiotics. Although studies  
are limited, certain types of bacterial strains have 
been found to reduce symptoms of irritable bowel 
syndrome, particularly bloating. Otherwise, a study 
found that eating fermented foods 1–5 times weekly 
is associated with a subtle change in gut bacteria.  
In general, though, healthy people should not 
require probiotic supplements.
A key benefit of prebiotic foods is that different 
types of the nondigestible fibers within the food are 
broken down by gut bacteria, which then produces 
gut protective short-chain fatty acids. Some studies 
show that eating a type of dietary fiber called  
inulin can help maintain the gut’s mucus barrier  
and prevent inflammation. It’s best to increase  
prebiotic food intake gradually, to avoid bloating.

WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS  
OF A POOR DIET?
A poor diet is one that isn’t providing enough crucial nutrients to keep you in  
optimal health, or your body’s energy needs and your appetite in balance.  
Over the long term, it could also have life-limiting effects.
A key way of defining a poor diet is one that is high 
in salt, sugar, and saturated fat. US health guidelines 
recommend a daily intake of <2,300mg of sodium, 
<10% total calories of added sugar, and <10% total 
calories of saturated fat (pp. 64, 66, and 70). 
Preprepared food is responsible for much of the 
excess; three-quarters of the salt in our diet comes 
from processed foods, including staples like bread, 
while three large slices of takeout vegetable pizza 
could contain around 12g of salt. But fast food is 
only one factor—adding a tablespoon of soy sauce  
to a healthy vegetable stir-fry could increase its salt 
content by up to 3g. 
Poor diet is not only about eating too much of  
the “wrong” foods; it can also mean not consuming 
enough nutrient-dense foods. In 2017, a global study 
of diet and mortality found that eating low amounts 
of healthy foods—including whole grains, fruits and 
vegetables, and nuts and seeds—was associated with 
more deaths than a diet with too much salt, sugar-
sweetened drinks, red and processed meats, and 
trans fats. A low intake of whole grains was the 
single dietary factor associated with most deaths 
in the US and western Europe. Of course, multiple 
lifestyle factors can contribute to poor health, but 
diet is an area where people can take some control. 
HEALTH IMPLICATIONS
The same study estimated that one in five deaths 
worldwide were associated with eating a poor diet, 
with cardiovascular disease (including heart disease, 
heart failure, and stroke) the leading global cause  
of diet-related deaths. 
Poor diet is mainly associated with weight gain.  
In the US, three-quarters of adults are classed as 
overweight or obese, and more than half have at  
least one preventable chronic disease related to diet. 
While excess body fat is often not a choice, people 
with obesity are three times more likely to develop 
colon cancer and five times more likely to develop 
type 2 diabetes. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) wants to reduce the adult global 
population’s intake of salt by 30 percent to halve 
cases of diabetes and stroke by 2025, due to the 
association between excess salt and raised blood 
pressure (see pages 70–71). 
SHOULD I EAT FEWER CALORIES?
In terms of overall calories, recommended daily 
adult intakes in the US are 2,000 for women and 
2,500 for men. Chronic overconsumption may lead 
to unhealthy body fat levels and increase the risk  
of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and 
some cancers. However, occasionally eating more 
calories than you need is unlikely to impact your 
health. Instead of focusing simply on the number  
of calories, consider whether you have enough 
variety in your daily diet and its quality as a whole.

WHY DO SO MANY OF  
US HAVE POOR DIETS?
The reasons people don’t eat a healthy, balanced diet are complex  
and often interlinked. They can range from access to a wide choice of different  
foods to psychological influences they may not even be aware of.
Lack of education about food, and an unhealthy 
relationship with it, are key factors contributing to 
poor diets in developed countries. Giving sweets  
to an upset child arguably creates an emotional 
association; as an adult, that person is more likely  
to reach for sugary carbohydrates to self-soothe 
against stress or anxiety.  Animal and human studies 
show that certain foods, especially those high in  
fat, carbohydrates, and salt, stimulate the brain’s 
reward centers. The Yale Food Addiction Scale was 
developed to identify markers relating to certain 
foods, although this is a controversial area with 
conflicting research. But evidence clearly shows that 
the more highly palatable the food, the more likely  
it is to be consumed for pleasure—called “hedonic” 
eating (see pages 58–59). Manufacturers design the 
specific flavors and textures of foods like chips and 
ice cream to ensure people will want to eat more.
ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY
One report found that the lowest income populations 
spent 36 percent more of their income on food when 
compared to the highest income populations who 
spent just 8 percent on food. US consumers spend 
an average of 8.6 percent of their income on food, 
but as incomes rise, money spent on food represents 
a smaller portion of the budget. Studies show that 
Learn to say “No”
HAVE YOU EVER ACCEPTED AN EXTRA HELPING 
EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE FULL? 
We seem to be susceptible to eating more with 
others than alone, although the underlying reasons 
aren’t clear. Some "social facilitation" studies show 
eating with friends and family in particular can 
increase intake; this could be because chatting 
with others distracts attention from food, or eating 
a greater amount is more acceptable in larger 
groups. A research review suggests meals eaten 
socially could be a third to a half bigger.
low-income individuals and those using public 
programs like SNAP spend and intake more sweets 
and salty snacks. Millions also live in “food deserts,” 
or areas with limited access to supermarkets or 
grocery stores that can make it harder to eat a 
healthy diet. Easier access to fast food, including 
takeout delivery, can be more tempting than cooking 
at home (see pages 46–47). Obesity prevalence is 
much higher in low-income children and adolescents 
than in higher income groups with nearly 19 percent 
and 11 percent, respectively. With higher rates of 
obesity comes diet-related disease that may impact 
their quality of life.

Processed food isn’t automatically inferior or 
unhealthy compared to fresh. Some nutrient-rich 
whole foods like vegetables, fish, milk, or whole 
grains are processed simply for storage or 
preservation; for example, freezing happens  
straight after harvest, so freshly picked foods  
arrive in stores at near peak nutritional value.
Likewise, canning is processing but retains  
much of the protein of fish and the fiber of fruits  
and vegetables. However, skinless fruit in syrup has 
less fiber and more sugar than whole fruit; choose 
fruit in water, or discard the syrup, or beans in  
water rather than sauce or brine.
Certain processed foods have been altered for 
flavor or texture or have additives to extend shelf 
life; even so, foods like whole wheat bread, rolled 
oats, sauerkraut, and tomato paste still fit easily  
into healthy eating. Some are fortified to replace 
vitamins or minerals lost during processing or to 
boost nutrients for plant-based eaters. 
HIGHLY PROCESSED FOODS
These should be limited in a healthy, balanced diet. 
They typically combine already modified ingredients 
and additives and are either ready to eat or need 
minimal preparation; examples include many sweets, 
chips, baked goods, and ready meals. They lack much 
of the original whole food’s fiber, making them easily 
digestible, while added salt, sugar, and fats also make 
them highly palatable. The mechanisms behind their 
suggested addictive nature include sugar’s ability to 
stimulate the brain’s reward centers. 
In the US, nearly 60 percent of average daily 
energy intake is now said to come from highly 
processed foods; evidence suggests rising sales and 
obesity rates are associated (although obesity has 
many causes). For example, high-fructose corn  
syrup is a type of sugar widely added to highly 
processed foods in the US; since the body has no 
biochemical reactions that use it, excess is turned 
into fat in the liver.
SHOULD I AVOID  
PROCESSED FOOD?
There are good reasons why processed food is a large part of the modern diet— 
it’s often cheaper than fresh, allows for a huge amount of choice, and is convenient. 
But not all processed food is equal, and it’s important to understand the differences.
Degrees of processing 
Any food you buy in a supermarket 
will have undergone some form of 
processing, but the impact on its 
nutritional value can vary widely. 
Corn, for example, can be eaten in  
a range of different forms, including  
as a refined ingredient in highly 
processed foods.
Fresh sweet corn 
 This is still in its natural 
state, although it may have 
been cleaned prior to sale.

Are additives bad?
ADDITIVES ARE OFTEN USED IN PROCESSED FOODS 
TO IMITATE NATURAL FLAVORS, MAKE FOOD FEEL 
BETTER IN THE MOUTH, OR AID WITH PROCESSING. 
They can be synthetic or naturally derived, like 
ascorbic acid, which is vitamin C. Monosodium 
glutamate (MSG) is a widely used flavor enhancer. 
While there is a lack of evidence on its long-term 
effects on health, some studies have suggested a 
link with obesity, central nervous system disorders, 
and liver damage. Additives are rigorously tested and 
deemed safe for use; if you have concerns, check 
labels and reduce your intake.

================================================================================

Checking the nutrition panel on food packaging  
can, for example, help you spot that a low-fat  
yogurt has had extra sugar added, making a  
higher-fat option with less sugar a smarter choice. 
Rules around nutritional labeling vary in different 
countries; in the US, most prepackaged foods must 
show the following per serving: 
 
  Energy in kilocalories or calories 
  Total and saturated fats  
  Protein 
  Total carbohydrates from sugars that are  
added and naturally present  
  Salt, which may also be listed as “sodium” 
The nutrition label must show the number of 
servings per package and may also show nutritional 
information per entire package. Manufacturers can 
choose whether to show information about vitamins, 
minerals, dietary fiber, and certain nutrients.   
HEALTH CLAIMS
Health, nutrient content, and structure/function 
claims are useful for making a quick decision about  
a product and comparing similar items. They aren’t 
mandatory, and some show only the amount of 
energy (calories), but they visually display whether 
the food is low, medium, or high in salt, sugar, and 
saturated fat. The numbers tell you how much of 
each is in a portion, both in grams and as a share of 
the total daily recommended amount. Food suppliers 
can decide on the portion size shown on the label, 
which could be less than what’s inside the package—
so if you eat extra, you’ll consume more than it says. 
SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION  
TO FOOD LABELS?
Nutritional information on food packaging can appear confusing at first.  
But it’s not too difficult to decode the data, and understanding it will let you  
make more informed choices about your daily diet.

CAN I TRUST MARKETING 
BUZZWORDS? 
Food manufacturers and suppliers spend huge amounts on crafting messages  
that influence our perceptions about nutritional value, to entice us to choose  
their particular product. Don’t take these at face value.
Claims on food packaging can be about health, 
nutritional content, or structure/function and are 
regulated by the FDA. To be FDA approved, the 
claim must be supported by the totality of publicly 
available scientific evidence. A US study found that 
highlighting added vitamins in snacks made 
consumers more likely to view them as healthier  
and less likely to check the nutrition label. 
NO ADDED SUGAR
“Sugar free” means one serving contains less than 
0.5g of sugar, both natural and added. “No added 
sugar” refers only to sugars added during 
processing, not naturally occurring sugar, such as 
fructose in fruit. A no-added-sugar fruit smoothie, 
for example, could potentially contain more sugar 
than a can of soda. 
 
LOW/LIGHT
The claim “low” refers to the following amounts 
compared to a given reference amount: <40 calories; 
<3g total fat; <1g saturated fat (with no more than 
15% of calories coming from saturated fat); <140mg 
sodium; and <20mg cholesterol (and only when a 
food contains <2g of saturated fat per serving). 
Food that derives less than 50% of its calories from 
fat can be labeled “light” or “lite” if its total amount 
of calories is decreased by at least 33.3% or its fat 
content is reduced by at least 50% compared to a 
standard/original version. 
 
Unhealthy influence 
SOCIAL MEDIA IS A MATRIX OF MISINFORMATION 
AND PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC CLAIMS. 
For example, nearly half of social media users 
reportedly think cutting out a whole food group is 
healthy. A study of nine popular UK influencers 
blogging about weight management found that 
only two had relevant qualifications, and five didn’t 
cite evidence-based references for nutrition claims. 
Influencers often have a commercial agenda—be 
wary of their recommendations around food. 
HIGH FIBER
Food products that contain at least 10% DV or 2.5g 
of fiber per serving can claim they are a “good 
source of fiber,” and those containing at least 20% 
DV of fiber or 5g or more of fiber per serving can 
label the product with a high fiber claim.  
 
NATURAL/ORGANIC
The FDA defines “natural” as having nothing 
artificial or synthetic (including all color additives) 
included in or added to the food. The claim “100% 
organic” can appear on any product that contains 
100% organic ingredients (excluding salt and water). 
GOOD SOURCE/EXCELLENT SOURCE
If a food contains 10–19% DV of a certain nutrient, 
it’s considered a “good source.” An “excellent source” 
has at least 20% DV of a certain nutrient.

================================================================================
64
IS SUGAR THE ENEMY? 
Although sugar has been regarded the enemy for a long while, the truth is that  
not all sugars are bad for us. Sugar has its place in the diet—in the right  
quantities and in a form your body can handle comfortably.
Sugar is a carbohydrate found in many foods  
(see pages 12–13). Foods containing natural sugars, 
such as fruits and dairy products, are good sources 
of many nutrients and the energy provided by sugar. 
Despite its bad reputation, scientists have not 
proved that sugar affects health when it is not part 
of a diet too high in calories. 
ADDED SUGARS
Added sugar might be sugar added to an oat bar 
during production or a spoonful of honey in  
herbal tea. 
Foods containing added sugars often have little or 
no nutritional benefit. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) recommends no more than 5 percent of 
daily energy intake comes from added sugars.
Sugars, often chemically produced, are added 
to products to enhance palatability. Check sugar 
content on labels (see pages 60–61). It may be referred  
to as “total sugars,” which includes naturally 
occurring and added sugars. Sugar comes in many 
forms—sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, fruit 
juice, molasses, corn and other syrups, honey, and 
fruit juice concentrate.
Avoid high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which  
is packaged into many foods in the US. Countries 
consuming HFCS the most show higher levels of 
diabetes. It has been shown that a diet of more than 
150g per day of HFCS reduces insulin sensitivity 
(see page 172), increasing the risk of developing  
high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. 
THE RIGHT BALANCE
Science confirms what we all know—sugar affects 
the feel-good reward center in the brain. It triggers a 
pleasure response that’s similar to how we feel when 
watching cute puppies or receiving love. Perhaps 
that explains why sugar provides more calories in

While not an added sugar, fruit juice 
is an example of a "free" sugar. Once 
the sugar it contains is separated 
from the fruit’s pulp, the fiber (and 
bulk) is lost. You wouldn’t eat four 
oranges in one sitting, but you might

orange juice—which is more sugar 
than you’d find in a can of soda!

our diets than is advisable. But there’s no need to 
demonize it. Psychology plays a major role in the 
nutrition choices we make. Going teetotal on any 
food may lead to binging; moderation is best. 
REDUCING SUGAR
Ensure you’re aware of how much sugar you are 
consuming, so you can make appropriate choices  
to help you stay within the recommended allowance.
Swap out sugary foods for alternatives. Substitute 
cookies, and add fruit instead of sugar to breakfast 
cereals, for instance. 
Have smaller portions. Share dessert with a loved 
one. Ask for sugar-laden dressings on the side so  
you can use less. Condiments like ketchup can have 
23g of sugar per 100g; use 1 teaspoon per serving. 
When cooking, don’t add sugar to savory foods.
Nearly a quarter of the added sugar in our diets 
comes from sugar-sweetened beverages (fizzy drinks, 
sweetened juices, and fruit-flavored beverages). 
Swap sugary drinks for water. 
It may take time to settle into your new habits, 
but there is no conclusive research linking sugar 
with physical addiction in humans. You can’t 
experience withdrawal symptoms as you would  
with a dependency on alcohol or drugs. 
Sugar alternatives
IF YOU DRINK MANY SUGAR-SWEETENED 
BEVERAGES, CONSIDER USING SWEETENERS 
TO HELP YOU GRADUALLY WEAN YOURSELF 
OFF ADDING SUGAR TO TEA OR COFFEE.
Molasses, maple syrup, and honey come  
from natural sources. Artificial sweeteners, such 
as sucralose, aspartame, and saccharine,  
are chemically manufactured. Both natural and 
artificial sweeteners are safe to use in 
moderation. There is some research suggesting 
that the latter are not beneficial to the gut 
microbiome, but as this is a relatively new field 
of research, the  evidence is not conclusive.

IS FAT STILL BAD FOR ME?
Scientific thinking on fat has shifted dramatically in recent decades, and it’s a complex 
area that is still developing today. However, there is general agreement that we  
should all enjoy some healthier fats within our diet.
Fat is actually crucial to our well-being. It gives us 
energy, delivers flavor to food, and helps us feel full 
and satisfied. The body requires fat to absorb certain 
vitamins. We should try to include both mono- and 
polyunsaturated fats, particularly omega-3 fatty 
acids, which come only from diet and are proven  
to help lower LDL (low-density lipoprotein) 
cholesterol and support heart health and cognition. 
ARE THERE "BAD" FATS?
Research has discredited the broad “fat is bad” 
viewpoint that led to a proliferation of low-fat diet 
plans and foods. A 2017 study explored reduced-fat 
diets over eight years and found no noticeable 
health benefits over diets that didn’t restrict fat;  
one possible factor may be eating the extra sugar 
often added by manufacturers to replace lost flavor. 
Trans fats, or artificially hardened vegetable oils, 
are banned in several countries, including the US, 
due to concerns they raise LDL cholesterol, a cause 
of heart disease and stroke. They are used rarely  
in UK foods, at very low levels—look for “partially 
hydrogenated” on labels. Saturated fat is found 
mainly in animal-derived foods and cereal products 
like pizza and cookies. There is evidence that a high 
intake of saturated fat raises LDL cholesterol. 
Recently, scientific debate has emerged over the 
link between saturated fat and heart disease, with 
one research review suggesting that saturated fat 
doesn’t raise the risk of heart disease. However, the 
American and British Heart associations advise that 
replacing saturated fat with unsaturated lowers the 
risk, and health bodies, including the World Health 
Organization, advise limiting saturated fat to no 
more than 10%–11% of daily calories. Most experts 
agree that a healthy diet will do more to reduce

fatty acids per 100g, making 
some a healthier choice.  
Their versatility for cooking 
depends on their smoke

Red meat is red when raw and includes lamb, beef, 
venison, pork, and veal. It’s a rich source of muscle-
building protein and important micronutrients, 
notably vitamins B3 and B12 (not available from 
plants), iron, zinc, and selenium. While it’s nutritious, 
it can be high in saturated fat, especially fattier cuts; 
3.5oz of prime rib contains around 34g of total fat. 
One limited study found organic meat contains  
50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids, known to 
support the heart and immune system, possibly 
because livestock eat a more grass-based diet.
Processed meats like ham, bacon, and salami  
have been cured, salted, smoked, or otherwise  
altered to improve flavor and for longer life and 
often contain a lot of salt. A diet high in salt and 
saturated fat has been shown to raise blood  
pressure and LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease. 
CANCER RISK
The pigment in fresh red meat, called heme, and 
nitrite or nitrate preservatives used in processing 
have both been linked to increased bowel cancer  
risk. Although nitrites also occur naturally in green 
vegetables, the way the body digests them in meat 
can create toxic nitrosamines. In 2015, World Health 
Organization cancer experts identified red meat as  
a probable cause of cancers and processed meats a 
definite cause (although not how many cases they 
cause). However, not all processed meat products 
SHOULD I CUT  
OUT RED MEAT?
We know that consuming different kinds of protein—including plants, fish, and  
poultry—is a sensible step toward healthy eating. But if you really enjoy things like 
steaks and hot dogs, consider their nutritional and health implications.   
What’s in your sausage?
NOT ALL SAUSAGES ARE NUTRITIONALLY EQUAL 
IN TERMS OF MEAT, SALT, AND FAT CONTENT.  
For example, a survey found salt in premade 
sausages varied from 0.75g to 2.3g per 3.5oz. Freshly 
made sausages or burgers may be a healthier choice 
and may not be a cancer risk unless they are further 
modified—ask your butcher what’s in them. One 
research review noted the link between colorectal 
cancers and sodium nitrite but claimed this isn’t 
added to most traditional sausages.  
contain nitrites; for example, traditionally  
produced prosciutto di Parma is cured with salt.
One recent US study concluded that evidence 
didn’t support eating less red or processed meat,  
but this was challenged by several health bodies.  
The World Cancer Research Fund advises adults  
to eat little or no processed meat and up to  
12oz–18oz cooked weight of red meat weekly, while 
some guidelines suggest regular consumers eat no 
more than 3oz in total a day. A more recent finding 
concluded that eating 3oz daily—about three  
slices of ham—could still elevate cancer risk,  
although overall diet and lifestyle matters, too.  
If you eat red meat, opt for unprocessed, lean  
cuts with plenty of vegetables.

WILL SALT GIVE ME  
A HEART ATTACK? 
If you like to add salt to your meals but you’ve never thought much about the  
salt content that’s in so many everyday foods, from baked beans to cookies,  
there is a chance your eating habits could be harming your health.
In 2018, an international study gained headlines  
for concluding that this risk would require a 
significantly higher average salt intake than most 
people actually eat (China being an exception),  
but the basis of the research was challenged.  
The WHO continues to advise adults to restrict  
salt intake to 5g (5,000mg) a day.
ARE PREMIUM SALTS HEALTHIER? 
Sea salt crystals and flakes and coarse 
mined rock salt like Himalayan pink salt 
are less refined than table salt, which has 
minerals removed as it is finely ground 
and anti-caking agents are added. 
Salt is partly made of sodium, and our bodies need 
some sodium for biological processes like fluid 
regulation and nerve impulse transmission. But 
research estimates that US adults consume an 
average 3,400mg of salt a day; the US guideline daily 
limit is 2,300mg—about a teaspoon.
For decades, the consensus among leading  
health bodies and experts, including the 
World Health Organization (WHO), has 
been that eating too much sodium can 
lead to high blood pressure, a major  
risk factor for stroke, kidney disease,  
and cardiovascular disease, which  
can lead to heart attack.

Although one survey found that nearly two-
thirds of people think sea salt contains less 
sodium, the American Heart Association says 
table salt and most sea salts are around 40 
percent sodium by weight, and there are no 
health reasons for choosing sea salt. 
"HIDDEN" SALT
Many people don’t realize they are eating too 
much salt because around 75 percent of the  
salt in our diet is already in processed and 
preprepared foods. It’s no surprise foods like  
soy sauce, processed meats, and many snacks 
and ready-made meals are high in salt. But it’s 
also present in foods you might not expect,  
like cookies and cakes, and those you may eat 
regularly, like bread and cereals. Even vegetables 
can be high in salt when canned in brine—if  
you can’t buy fresh veggies, it may be better  
to choose frozen because salt isn’t used  
during freezing. 
Salt content in similar products can vary,  
so check labels. These may list salt or sodium; 
multiply sodium by 2.5 to get the salt content.
REDUCING SALT:
  Aim to reduce salt gradually—our taste  
buds get used to salt intake, so it should get 
easier over time. Check food labels and opt for 
products containing less salt where possible.  
  Experiment with herbs and spices for  
flavor; keep plenty of dried options handy.
  In restaurants, ask for your meal to be 
prepared without added salt. 
EXCESS

The body reacts to excess salt 
by retaining water in the blood,

SURELY CAFFEINE  
CAN’T BE GOOD FOR ME? 
Caffeine is the world’s most commonly consumed psychoactive 
substance, but is it okay to have as much as you like? 
Caffeine occurs naturally in coffee, cocoa, and 
tea plants and is added to some drinks, food, and 
medications. It boosts alertness by stimulating 
the central nervous system and blocking 
adenosine, a molecule that reduces heart rate 
and promotes sleep. 
Moderate caffeine intake—around 300mg–
400mg per day, or 3–4 cups of coffee—can have 
beneficial effects, including a reduced risk of 
heart disease and enhanced concentration.  
Many studies show that caffeine aids athletic 
performance, for instance, by boosting metabolic 
rate and glycogen (fuel) storage if taken prior to 
high-intensity interval training. Research (albeit 
not as strong) also suggests caffeine may help  
relieve headaches and migraines. Most studies 
are based on coffee, which also contains 
Adrenaline rush: Consuming caffeine 
increases brain activity, prompting the 
release of adrenaline and a series 
of “fight-or-flight” effects.

CAN I HAVE TOO MUCH?
More than 600mg of caffeine daily can cause 
anxiety, upset stomach, and raised blood 
pressure; frequent consumption may worsen 
irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. If taken 
less than six hours before bed, caffeine can 
disrupt sleep; it may also stimulate a need to 
urinate. Pregnant women should limit intake to 
200mg daily, due to an association with low 
birth weight and miscarriage. Despite some 
scientific debate on the issue, the World Health 
Organization recognizes caffeine addiction as a 
clinical disorder. Reactions to caffeine vary, but 
many can safely enjoy moderate consumption.

DOES ALCOHOL HAVE  
ANY BENEFITS? 
While moderate alcohol intake may have some positive health impacts,  
the risks of drinking in excess are well established.  
Alcohol has no nutritional benefits that warrant 
introducing it. Several studies have associated 
moderate consumption of any alcohol with 
lower risk of coronary heart disease; however, 
definitions of “moderate” vary. 
Red wine can contain organic compounds 
called polyphenols; their antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory properties may have preventive 
and/or therapeutic effects for cardiovascular 
disease, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer,  
and obesity. Red wine has around 10 times  
more polyphenols than white. Comparisons 
show lower incidences of heart disease in wine-
drinking countries like France compared to 
those with a higher intake of beer or spirits, 
such as Germany and Russia (although wine-
drinking countries often have healthier diets, 
and this is based on moderate consumption). 
MAXIMUM AMOUNTS
The US’s recommended alcohol intake is one 
drink or less per day for women and two drinks 
or less per day for men (on days when alcohol is 
consumed). One alcohol drink is equivalent to 
12oz of regular beer, 5oz of wine, or 1.5oz of 
80-proof distilled spirits. 
Heavier, and prolonged, drinking can lead  
to health problems, including increased blood 
pressure, heart disease, liver disease, and 
depression. Alcohol also stimulates appetite, and 
one survey suggested that 80 percent of people 
are not aware of the calories in a glass of wine. 
Drinking patterns also matter. A study found 
consuming around one drink daily across four or 
more days a week resulted in lower death rates 
than the same amount over 1–2 days. To reduce 
intake, aim for several alcohol-free days a week.
Calories in alcohol: Spirits 
tend to have fewest calories 
per serving, without mixers.

WILL SUPERFOODS SAVE ME?
So-called "superfoods" seem to be everywhere, from social media to supermarket 
shelves, with new arrivals constantly being talked about. Are these foods all hype  
or healthy enough to earn our attention—and their price?
No single food can compensate for an unhealthy 
diet or prevent illness. So-called “superfoods” 
supposedly offer a particular health benefit or 
promote wellness—in fact, this is a marketing term 
to entice us into buying more of various exotic-
sounding foods. It appears to work: in 2015 alone, 
the number of new products labeled “superfood,” 
“supergrain,” or “superfruit” rose by a third.
Foods often called “super,” like spirulina and goji 
berries, can pack a nutritional punch—3.5oz of dried 
goji berries contains 4mg of vitamin A, compared to 
2.5mg in fresh carrots. Research suggests their mix 
of phytochemicals and high nutrient levels can help 
improve overall health, support the immune system, 
regulate mood by increasing serotonin, and more. 
However, a lot of this comes from animal studies. 
It’s also worth noting that we can absorb only a 
certain amount of any nutrient. Even supposed 
superfoods are beneficial only when consumed in 
moderation, as part of a balanced diet; for example, 
turmeric and curcumin can increase bile secretion. 
Check with your doctor before consuming.  
COST OF "SUPERFOODS"
These foods are often more expensive than common 
fruits and vegetables with similar nutritional 
benefits. For example, 3.5oz of papaya contains 61mg 
of vitamin C, compared to 77.6mg in bell peppers, 
while a cup of whole milk has significantly more 
calcium than 3.5oz of spirulina. Although goji berries 
have more vitamin A than carrots by weight, over a 
week, you’re likely to eat more carrots—and so take 
in as much, if not more, vitamin A at less cost. At the 
time of writing, in one supermarket, goji berries 
were 40 times more expensive than carrots per 3.5oz.
In addition to expense, foods like goji berries, açai, 
spirulina, and chia may be hard to find. Buying more 
readily available alternatives could help offset some 
of the environmental concerns around importing 
foods from around the globe.

IS ORGANIC BETTER FOR YOU?  
Many people now think organic food is safer, healthier, and tastier than regular food. 
Others say it’s better for the environment and improves animal welfare. You can pay 
up to 200 percent more for an organic label, but is it all marketing hype?
The focus of organic production is usually based on 
environmental sustainability and human well-being. 
It is easy to see how organic is perceived as healthier, 
the image of wildlife and nature untouched by 
mankind, it can paint a very vivid picture in our 
imaginations of the way we want to see the food  
we eat in harmony with the world. 
People are willing to pay more for this ideal. 
Organic food comes with a price tag, so while the 
more privileged among us may be able to shop 
organic, for many people, it is simply not an option. 
THE EVIDENCE ON ORGANIC
While there may be respected studies that find more 
nutrients in organic foods, a great many others have 
found insufficient evidence to recommend organic 
over nonorganic for health or safety. One review  
of 233 studies concluded that there is no strong 
evidence to suggest that organic foods are 
Organic certification
TO MAKE AN ORGANIC CLAIM, A PRODUCT MUST 
FOLLOW STRICT PRODUCTION, HANDLING, AND 
LABELING STANDARDS, AND GO THROUGH A 
CERTIFICATION PROCESS. 
The four distinct labeling categories for organic 
products are: 100 percent organic—made with 100 
percent certified organic ingredients; organic—
certified organic, except where specified on the 
National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substance; 
made with organic ingredients—at least 70 
percent of the product is made with certified 
organic ingredients; and specific organic 
ingredients—less than 70 percent certified organic 
content, doesn’t need to be certified.
significantly more nutritious than conventionally 
farmed foods. This was also the conclusion of the 
UK Food Standards Agency (FSA), though their 
research considered just 11 studies. (The FSA 
publicly supports consumer choice and is not pro-  
or anti-organic food.)
There are some small nutritional differences in 
organic foods, but they are marginal and won’t play a 
significant difference in overall health. Some organic 
products have been found to be a bit higher in 
phosphorus but lower in protein. Organic cow’s milk 
may contain higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, 
iron, and vitamin E than nonorganic but, again,  
less of other nutrients such as selenium and iodine. 
Agricultural research is renowned for varying 
results. The nutrient content of food depends on  
so many factors, including soil quality, weather 
conditions, and when the crops are harvested (which 
differs throughout the world). The composition of 

================================================================================
HOW CAN WE EAT WELL? 77
dairy products and meat can also be affected by 
differences in genetics and what diet animals are  
fed. Even the natural variations in the production 
and handling of foods make comparisons difficult. 
So the results of these studies should be interpreted 
with caution.
Ultimately, there is not enough strong evidence 
available to prove that eating organic foods provides 
added health benefits when compared to eating 
conventionally farmed foods. 
PESTICIDES
Conventional farming relies on the use of chemical 
pesticides. Although overall they are safe, we are 
advised to wash our produce before we eat it  
to remove pesticide residues. Some research 
suggests that high exposure to pesticides 
in early life may harm cognitive 
development, but findings are mixed.

SHOULD I CHANGE MY DIET  
IF I’M EXERCISING?
Anyone who’s getting more serious about fitness can learn from sports nutrition for 
elite athletes—eat the right balance of food groups for your personal training goals. 
Carbohydrate is the main fuel for any exercise; it 
promotes strength and endurance, delays muscle 
fatigue, and speeds up recovery, meaning fewer 
injuries. It is converted to glucose, and excess is 
stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles, 
providing instantly available energy. The longer  
and/or more intense the training, the faster glycogen 
depletes and fatigue can set in. Resistance training 
plus protein builds muscle, but without enough 
carbohydrate, protein will be used for energy 
instead. Stepping up training can increase appetite, 
so it’s easy to eat more than your body really needs.
FAT
Dietary fat must be converted into fatty acids  
before being taken up by muscles; it acts as support 
fuel during low-intensity endurance exercise like 
long-distance running, when glycogen runs low. 
Slower availability is also why you should avoid 
eating fats just before training. At least 15–20 
percent of overall calorie intake should come  
from healthy fats.
 
PROTEIN
Protein’s primary role is to build, and rebuild, 
muscle. Aim to eat 0.8g–1g per kg/2lb of body weight 
daily—in the lower range for endurance and higher 
for strength training. Opt for lean or low-fat foods 
like skinless chicken and yogurt. Protein is more 
effectively absorbed from food than supplements. 
ENERGY BALANCE
Signs that your diet isn’t meeting your energy  
needs include fatigue, poor sleep quality, and 
irregular bowel movements.

HOW IMPORTANT IS  
HYDRATION?
Proper hydration is essential before, during, and after exercise;  
otherwise, physical and mental performance can be 
compromised.
When the body doesn’t get enough fluids, the 
blood thickens, making the heart work less 
efficiently and increasing heart rate. While  
some sweat can be lost without affecting your 
workout, after a point, fluid and sodium loss may 
impact performance by up to 20 percent. You 
can feel tired and everything becomes harder.
 
HYDRATION ZONE
Research shows being properly hydrated  
when you start training gives the best chance  
of optimum performance. Drinking 13oz–20oz 
about two hours beforehand gives the body  
time to excrete what you don’t need and makes 
up for any previous fluid deficit. 
Men should drink around 15.5 cups  
(3.7 liters) of water daily and women around 
11.5 cups (2.7 liters), but you can lose 1.5–4 
liters while training. Weigh yourself before and 
after to see how much you drop through fluid 
loss, taking into account any fluid consumed 
during exercise. Aim to stay within 2 percent of 
your body weight; if you weigh 143lb at the start 
of your workout, you should weigh no less than 
140lb at the end. This is your “hydration zone.”
After exercise, for every 2lb (1kg) of water 
weight lost, gradually drink 5–6 cups of water 
over about an hour (the extra 1–2 cups 
compensates for increased urination). A little 
sodium (salt) in food or drink helps retain fluid. 
Drinking too much may cause hyponatraemia,  
or abnormally low sodium in the blood, which 
can lead to blackouts and fits. Be aware that 
symptoms (including lethargy, dizziness, and 
nausea) can mimic those of dehydration; if  
these persist, seek medical attention.
KIDNEYS
BLADDER
Hydration and  
kidneys: Staying 
hydrated helps blood 
deliver nutrients to 
kidneys and enables 
them to expel waste  
as urine.
Water in the blood 
moves between 
blood cells and 
blood plasma in  
a process called 
osmosis—toward 
the highest 
concentration of 
sodium, in order 
to equalize their

HOW DO WE EAT WELL? 81
DO I NEED SPORTS 
SUPPLEMENTS?
If you regularly run or cycle long distances, build muscle strength at the gym, or 
otherwise train hard, supplementing a healthy, balanced diet can be a good way to fill 
in nutritional gaps, get extra fuel on workout days, or boost performance.
For most people who visit the gym or play sports 
recreationally, supplements aren’t necessary; they 
may have a place only if you’re on a low-calorie  
diet or unable to meet your nutritional needs. More 
intense exercise increases the body’s need for certain 
nutrients, but the International Olympic Committee 
says even elite athletes should for the most part be 
able meet their needs by eating a balanced diet. 
Supplements can be a useful addition to enhance 
performance, although an excess can potentially 
cause stomach pain, nausea, and constipation.
BEET JUICE 
Beets increase nitrate levels in the blood, which  
then helps dilate blood vessels and regulate blood 
pressure so more nutrients and oxygen can reach 
muscles during exercise, allowing you to sustain 
higher levels of power for longer. Drink beet juice 
2–3 hours before training. Nitrate is also found in 
veggies like spinach, arugula, broccoli, and cabbage.  
BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACIDS (BCAAs)
These are found in protein; leucine and isoleucine 
support muscle growth and repair and glucose 
uptake into cells, to fuel body and brain functions. 
Active people require 0.8g–1g of protein per kg/2lb 
of body weight per day; there are many food sources 
of BCAAs, including meat and eggs, although plant 
sources should be varied (see pages 128–129). The 
body can use 1g–3g of leucine, or around 20g–40g of 
protein, per meal for muscle synthesis (from 0.25g to 
0.4g of protein per kg/2lb of bodyweight, based on 
activity levels). While supplements support muscle 
growth over time, it’s cheaper to eat more protein.
PROTEIN POWDER
Only those with high energy requirements need to 
supplement protein. Whey protein is derived from 
cow’s milk; evidence suggests it’s the best form of 
protein to take after exercise, being absorbed by the 
body more quickly than others such as casein or soy. 
(Plant-based supplements combine soy, pea, and 
rice.) While it’s also a good source of leucine, studies 
show no evidence of greater muscle growth over  
24 hours from taking whey protein, as opposed to 
eating a normal, balanced diet.
CREATINE
Creatine is found in muscle cells, and supplements 
have proven effectiveness in increasing strength and 
power, especially for activities involving explosive 
movements. Red meat, fish, and poultry contain only 
small amounts of creatine, so supplementing is an 
option for boosting performance, and for vegetarians 
and vegans. Of the many types available, creatine 
monohydrate appears to be an effective option. 

================================================================================
82
WHEN SHOULD I EAT  
BEFORE EXERCISE?
Just as you wouldn’t set off on a long drive very low on fuel, you may need to  
top off your personal tank before training to get the most from a workout.  
Your goal is to have enough stored glycogen from 
carbohydrates when you start training to sustain 
performance throughout. If you exercise first thing, 
glycogen in the liver has been depleted overnight, 
although some is still present in muscles if your diet 
contains enough carbohydrates (see pages 78–79). 
Exercising on a full stomach can be uncomfortable,  
as blood is directed away from your digestive system. 
BEFORE EXERCISING
The consensus is to eat a meal 2–4 hours before 
working out, where possible. An ideal preworkout 
meal is mainly carbohydrate with some protein  
and a little fat, for example, salmon, white rice, and 
vegetables roasted in olive oil. If you train early and 
don’t have the time or appetite, try a more carb-
heavy meal the night before. If you’re exercising 
sooner, or need to top off, a snack (like toast and 
honey or fruit salad) 1–2 hours beforehand gives  
a burst of energy for fuel and is quickly absorbed. 
With under an hour, stick to liquids like smoothies 
or sports drinks. Experiment to find the optimal 
timing for your activity, schedule, and digestion.
 
DURING EXERCISE
Water should suffice for 45–75-minute sessions. 
After an hour, you may want to consume around  
30g of carbs per hour for two hours, increasing to 
60g per hour for the next 2–2.5 hours. Gels and 
sports drinks can help maintain blood sugar levels 
but can also contribute to stomach upset during 
endurance activities like distance running; practice 
what works for you.

IS IT BETTER TO REFUEL  
RIGHT AFTER EXERCISE?
The more frequently and intensively you train, the more important it is to replenish 
fluid and fuel afterward to avoid aching muscles, fatigue, and underperformance. 
While experts no longer believe refueling must 
happen within a 30-minute “anabolic window,” it  
can be a good idea for recreational athletes to refuel 
within a couple of hours of exercise. Glycogen levels 
replenish at 150 percent of the normal rate during 
this time, and muscle cell membranes are more 
permeable so they can absorb more glucose to 
restore glycogen levels faster. 
CARB–PROTEIN BALANCE
Recovery foods should contain quality carbohydrates 
to replenish glycogen and fluid and electrolytes to 
rehydrate effectively. In addition, combining a small 
amount of protein with carbs postworkout has been 
shown to more effectively promote glycogen recovery 
than carbohydrates alone. Flavored milks, smoothies, 
and fruit yogurts all check these boxes. Choose the 
fat and sugar content based on your individual body 
composition and energy needs. 
If your training is mainly strength based, or if 
you’re training at a high intensity, there is evidence 
that adding 15g–25g of protein to a postworkout 
meal or snack can reduce muscle soreness and 
promote muscle repair. (A 150g serving of edamame 
would provide this.)
Otherwise, follow your food preferences, appetite, 
and what sits comfortably in your stomach after 
exercise, and eat when you feel hungry. Overall daily 
energy and macronutrient intake is the priority; 
provided you consume enough calories, carbs, and 
protein over a 24-hour period, your muscles should 
recover before exercising again (see pages 78–79).

WILL I LOSE WEIGHT  
FASTER IF I EXERCISE?
Rapid weight loss is a popular goal, although generally the faster this happens, the 
less sustainable it is. If you’re already restricting calories, is exercise the missing 
piece in the puzzle of how to successfully reduce weight long term? 
Exercise burns extra calories, and expending more 
energy than we consume creates an energy deficit 
that leads to weight loss. In practice, though, 
exercising doesn’t guarantee less body fat. One 
reason may be unrealistic expectations; a study 
found people overestimated calories burned  
during exercise by 2–3 times the actual amount.
 
EXERCISE AND METABOLISM
Several investigations have shown huge variations in 
individual responses to exercise—this is because its 
effect on appetite depends on your hormones, body 
fat levels, and metabolism. The largest proportion  
of energy intake is used for basic physiological 
functions while doing nothing—your resting 
metabolic rate (RMR). Physical activity, including 
exercise, uses 10–30 percent, so its impact is limited.
Rapid weight loss can cause loss of muscle and 
slow your metabolic rate (see pages 92–93). Doing 
some weight-based exercise to build muscle may 
help offset this because muscle uses more energy—if 
you don’t consume extra calories. Sleep quality and 
stress also play a role in appetite and activity levels.  
CAN I JUST EXERCISE?
Studies indicate that while aerobic (cardio) exercise  
burns fat, diet has a bigger impact on weight loss 
than exercise. Combining exercise with diet appears 
to be more effective over both the short and long 
term. However, exercise is beneficial for maintaining 
lower weight; people who have done so for five years 
report exercising daily. 
What’s not in doubt are the many long-term 
health benefits of regular exercise. These include 
significantly reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, 
colon cancer, depression, and early death. 
One study defines successful weight loss as  
losing at least 10 percent of initial body weight  
Energy balance equation  
Weight loss requires a negative 
energy balance, with fewer 
calories eaten than used by 
resting metabolic rate, exercise, 
other non-exercise activity 
(NEAT), and the thermic  
effect of food (TEF), or  
energy used to digest it.

and keeping it off for one year. This suggests the 
best approach is slowly increasing the amount and 
intensity of exercise so it becomes an enjoyable 
lifestyle habit and your body has time to adapt.
ACTIVE LIVING
Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is  
the energy expended when we aren’t sleeping,  
eating, or exercising. Small daily changes  
in behavior, like standing up while reading  
or taking stairs, can all boost NEAT. One  
research review even estimated higher-level 
NEAT activities (like washing windows)  
could burn up to 2,000 calories extra daily.  
But fatigue resulting from exercise can also 
reduce NEAT.

WHICH EXERCISE IS  
BETTER AT FAT BURNING?
Body fat is distributed within muscles, around organs, and beneath skin, which 
means you can’t target specific areas of the body. However, you may have heard that 
some types of exercise are better for burning fat—do such shortcuts really exist?
When working out at lower intensities, like walking 
or steady running, your body will predominantly 
burn fat for fuel. In the gym, the “fat-burning” zone 
is usually indicated on a heart rate chart on cardio 
equipment like rowing machines and stair climbers. 
Staying within this zone keeps your heart rate, and 
your intensity, relatively low. This burns more 
calories from stored body fat rather than glycogen  
in the muscles and liver, and glucose in blood (both 
derived from carbohydrates). However, you’ll burn 
more calories overall—and therefore lose more 
weight—by working at a higher intensity for as long 
and as often as you can safely manage (supported by 
diet so you’re in an energy deficit; see pages 84–85).
FASTED CARDIO
Cardio exercise, like cycling, power-walking, running, 
and aerobics, raises your heart rate. Some studies 
have shown doing cardio on an empty stomach 
increases the rate of fat burning, because glycogen 
stores are depleted so the body takes more energy 
from fat. However, this may also cause breakdown  
of muscle tissue and increased appetite.
 
INTERVAL TRAINING
Combining bursts of high-intensity exercise like 
sprinting with intervals of less intense activity is 
often promoted as more effective for fat burning 
than maintaining a continuous moderate intensity,

analysis of 31 studies found high-intensity

for longer was more beneficial than shorter 
periods of interval training. 
Overall, evidence suggests interval training  
is better for improving overall fitness and 
respiratory and cardiovascular health than 
burning fat—unless you can sustain it for  
long enough.
SWITCH INTENSITIES
It’s sensible to mix up different intensities  
in your workout, to keep it interesting and to 
avoid injury. While weight-based resistance 
training is used to build muscle rather than 
burn fat, having more muscle can promote 
better fat burning when you’re not  
exercising (see pages 84–85).

IS IT GOOD TO BE SLIM?
‘‘Slim’’ is just one of many cultural constructs about how our bodies 
should look. But achieving these ideals and being a healthy weight 
aren’t necessarily related.  
Body size and shape aren’t always the best 
indicator of health. Someone who eats a less 
healthy diet and does little exercise may be 
genetically predetermined to have less body 
fat than someone in a larger body leading a 
healthier lifestyle. Scientists have identified 
specific DNA variants common to people 
with obesity, and in 2019 researchers found 
that obese people have a higher genetic risk 
score than those at a “normal” weight. 
A large body of evidence indicates that 
you are less likely to experience poor long-
term health if you don’t carry too much fat 
relative to your height and build. For 
example, being overweight makes you three 
times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes 
(seven times for those with obesity), while 
people who are overweight in middle age 
have a 35 percent increased risk of Alzheimer’s 
disease. Obesity is a risk factor for poor 
sleep, joint and bone problems, chronic 
noncommunicable diseases like cancer and 
coronary heart disease, and mental health 
disorders. In contrast, healthy weight 
individuals have improved fertility and 
greater chances of conceiving (see page 182).

"HEALTHY" WEIGHT
There are different measures of “healthy” and 
“overweight.” BMI (body mass index) is widely used 
by health professionals and has a strong correlation 
with various diseases and chronic conditions. 
However, it doesn’t reflect the amount of fat or 
muscle in a body, bone weight, or cultural factors, 
age, and gender (women tend to carry more fat). 
Waist circumference is another commonly used 
measure because excess abdominal fat—more than 
40 inches for men and 35 inches for women—
increases the risk of developing obesity-related 
Measuring BMI 
BMI expresses weight relative  
to height; however, very fit 
people like professional football 
players can have BMIs that 
appear unhealthy due to a high 
muscle-to-fat ratio. To calculate 
BMI, divide weight in pounds  
by height in square inches and 
multiply by 703: 212lb / (72.8in

potential risk, they aren’t diagnostic tools. 
Instead of using weight or measures like BMI  
to define well-being, an alternative “health at  
every size” approach focuses on sustainable health-
promoting behavior regardless of body size. 
Proponents argue a weight-neutral approach is 
healthier because it avoids the potentially harmful 
effects of repeated dieting, such as a higher risk of 
early death and psychological distress. Ultimately, 
nutrition and health are socioeconomic issues that 
require understanding and empathy.

IS THERE A LIMIT TO HOW  
MUCH WEIGHT I CAN LOSE?
Numerous studies have observed that when some people try to lose weight, their body 
appears to hold onto fat and may not let them either reach a target weight or sustain 
it long term. As yet, scientists don’t know precisely why this happens.
For many people, trying to lose weight works 
initially, then they hit a plateau and stop, or they 
reach their target weight only to find it rises again 
and they end up gaining pounds. Analysis of 29 
long-term weight-loss studies found that more than  
half of lost weight was regained within two years, 
and over 80 percent within five. 
SET POINT
Set point theory says this happens because we have  
a narrow, genetically determined range of weight  
the body is programmed to protect. When the brain 
detects fat levels have fallen below an established 
level, it adjusts certain hormones in order to burn 
energy more slowly and increase calorie intake. 
(These include leptin, a hormone in fat cells that 
helps suppress appetite, and ghrelin, which 
stimulates it.) As weight is regained, the weight 
range is set higher to protect fat stores. Scientists 
think these compensating mechanisms may keep 
working for up to a year. Some research also suggests 
repeated dieting means we develop resistance to  
key hormones, making it even harder to lose weight.
The set point concept is supported by significant 
observational study. But it doesn’t explain the 
relatively fast increase in Western populations’ body 
weight and adiposity (excess fat) since the 1980s, or 
why obesity levels vary with socioeconomic status. 
SETTLING POINT 
This newer theory says body weight gradually  
settles at a level reflecting our genetics but also  
any significant changes in our diet, activity, 
environment, lifestyle, and stress levels. There is 
research supporting both theories; taken together, 
they suggest that we have a predetermined weight 
range, but other factors can influence and change it.
CAN I RESET? 
Based on current evidence, weight loss can be 
maintained, but a gradual process is more effective. 
Losing a pound or two a week allows your body to 
adapt and is sustainable in the long run. This means 
eating fewer calories than you use but in a way that’s 
realistic, for example, by adding more vegetables to 
your diet and walking more rather than spending 
hours in the gym every day. Studies show increased 
physical activity positively affects body composition, 
but weight loss is individual and your body may 
react differently from someone else’s.

IF DIETS DON’T WORK,  
WHAT DOES? 
"Dieting" is often unsustainable, with one analysis of 14 popular diet programs finding 
that weight loss was mostly reversed after 12 months. By understanding how the 
concept affects our thinking, we can identify more effective approaches. 
As babies, we are in tune with our body’s hunger 
signals and eat only what we need, but as we age, 
we’re surrounded by messaging and social pressures 
around food and lose this innate ability. The 
complex psychology surrounding our relationship 
with food undoubtedly plays a role in the failure of 
diets and can be the biggest barrier to weight loss.
Research shows that restrained eaters experience 
more intense food cravings, heightened emotions 
surrounding food, and greater preoccupation with  
it. Likewise, categorizing foods as “good” or “bad” 
creates a restrictive mindset that increases food 
cravings and, in turn, the risk of overeating these 
foods when they are available. Labeling foods as 
treats implies they can be eaten only once earned, 
which increases desire. Goal setting can also have 
detrimental psychological effects, as veering “off 
plan” can prompt feelings of failure and guilt and 
subsequent overeating.
SLOW AND STEADY
Studies show that slow, steady weight loss over  
a longer time period is the most effective way to  
lose body fat. According to one study, sustained 
adherence to a diet—rather than following a  
certain type of diet—is the key to successful weight 
management. Instead of cutting out entire meals 
and risking fatigue and cravings, aim to control  
your portion sizes at each meal and choose healthier 
snacks between meals. Eating more variety is also 
thought to enhance weight loss; try different types 
of meals and vegetables each day.

HOW DO I FIND A WEIGHT-  
LOSS PROGRAM THAT  
WORKS FOR ME?
Rather than following a formal diet plan, fixating on calories, or avoiding particular 
foods, reaching and maintaining a healthy weight means finding a way of eating  
that works for your needs—maybe with some professional help.
Although there are many weight-loss plans to 
choose from, we don’t all respond to one-size-fits-all 
diets in the same way. A 2020 study into the three 
main types of programs (low carbohydrate, high 
protein, and low fat) concluded that none is more 
effective and results varied with each individual. 
Other research has demonstrated that the quality  
of the food we eat is an important factor in 
achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.  
“A calorie is a calorie” doesn’t tell the whole  
story; we need to consider each food’s overall 
nutritional facts and our habits over time. 
PERSONALIZING NUTRITION 
Studies on individualized nutrition are rare, but 
scientists conducting a large-scale and long-term 
observational study called Project 10K are looking  
at how participants respond to different foods,  
the makeup of their gut bacteria, and whether they 
should eat to suit their DNA. Results may lead to 
more research supporting personalized nutrition  
and eating for better health outcomes. 
Meanwhile, the ideal nutritional plan should 
provide flexibility and room for socializing, address 
emotional and physical needs, and help you feel 
good. It will consider:   
  What “healthy” means to you—maybe eating  
more greens or just less sugar
  How active you are and how often you exercise
  Your food preferences, knowledge, and concerns
  Your physical and mental health, including sleep 
quality, hormone function, and anxiety levels
  Your social, cultural, and family influences
  Realistic goals and support
Keep a food diary 
This is a good  
way to learn more 
about your personal 
eating patterns.  
It will help you 
understand how 
different people, 
times, events, and 
your mood, affect 
your intake.

example, "Cup of coffee: 1 tsp

PROFESSIONAL ADVICE
Registered dietitian nutritionists and qualified 
nutritionists can provide guidance on losing weight 
sustainably, as well as helping with other health and 
fitness issues. You’ll be questioned in depth about 
your health and history with food and what your 
goals are, and you may be asked to keep a food or 
lifestyle journal. Write down any questions you have 
beforehand, as it can be overwhelming discussing 
your life and eating habits at first. You should leave 
your session with notes, advice on next steps, and,  
in most cases, a scheduled follow-up appointment. 
Professional advice can be expensive; alternative 
options include self- and group-help programs and 
online planning tools.

DO I NEED TO GAIN WEIGHT?
Labels like "too thin" and "skinny" can be just as toxic as those put onto heavier 
people, especially if you are naturally in a smaller body. However, adding fat or  
muscle to your body is not as simple as increasing portion sizes.
Gaining weight is a complex issue. BMI (body mass 
index) is a standard measure for whether someone  
is overweight, healthy weight, or—if the score is less 
than 18.5—underweight. However, a 2019 study  
of 2,000 subjects with BMIs under 18 found that  
75 percent of them were genetically predisposed  
to be underweight and were examples of “healthy 
thinness.” So you may have no need to gain weight, 
even if your BMI indicates you should. (Although 
someone with a low BMI who appears healthy may 
still need to put on weight for optimal health.)
THE ROLE OF GENETICS
Some people are naturally underweight or smaller 
because their bodies are not set up to store adipose 
tissue, where lipids (fats) accumulate. Genes also 
play a role in our ability to grow muscles, which 
then affects how rapidly we burn energy. It’s often 
said that people in smaller bodies have great 
metabolisms; in fact, the larger and more muscular 
you are, the harder your metabolism works and the 
more calories you burn. Smaller people’s capacity 
for gaining weight partially depends upon their 
muscle mass. If this is high, they can find it more 
difficult to put on weight.
HEALTH IMPACT
Genetics aside, you may be under a healthy weight 
for your body for other reasons, such as stress, 
illness, or an eating disorder (see pages 32–33). 
Weighing too little can lead to fatigue and health 
problems like a weakened immune system, fragile 
bones, and missed periods. This may be because  
you are not eating enough to get enough key 
nutrients, such as calcium. Some people may not 
even be aware they are under their optimal body 
weight; warning signs that you may be include:
  Suppressed appetite
  Irregular bathroom habits, especially going less
  Thinning hair, hair loss, or dry skin
  Regularly feeling unwell
 
GAIN WEIGHT SAFELY
Simply eating more won’t work; the types of food 
you eat and your activity levels also need to adjust. 
Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian about 
gaining weight safely and sustainably. Broadly 
speaking, aim for 1–2lb of weight gain a week and  
do some low-intensity exercise. Eating more to gain 
weight can be challenging; to reduce portions, add 
some nutrient-dense foods that are high in calories, 
fat, or sugar, into a balanced diet, such as:
  Starchy (ideally whole grain) carbs like potatoes, 
bread, pasta, and rice 
  Full-fat milk (until your weight begins to rise)
  Unsaturated oils and spreads
  Nuts, seeds, and avocados for healthy fats
  Beans, eggs, pulses, meat, and fish for protein
  Yogurts, homemade milkshakes, and puddings  
for protein and calories.

SHOULD I COUNT  
CALORIES?
Counting helps build awareness of our daily energy consumption.  
But food is more than calories, and reducing it to a number risks  
oversimplifying its nourishment.
Monitoring calories can help you reach the energy 
deficit needed to lose weight. However, not all 
calories are nutritionally equal. Also, the body 
metabolizes foods differently; for instance, it may 
absorb more calories from a corn tortilla than from 
an equivalent amount of sweet corn (some of which 
may be visible in your toilet the next day!). In 
addition, calories may be more available to one 
person than to another. 
 
UNHEALTHY COUNTING
As well as being time consuming, calorie counting 
can lead to restrictive behaviors or unhealthy habits. 
It may be tempting to eat highly processed foods 
because calories are clearly displayed on packaging 
and easier to count, or to exclude nutrient-dense 
foods like oily fish and nuts purely  
on the basis of their calorie content. 
TRACKING TOOLS
Many people count using a fitness tracker; while 
these encourage regular activity, one study found 
that popular brands can overestimate the number  
of calories burned while walking by more than 50 
percent. Relying strictly on these tools, rather than 
using them to broadly gauge your energy intake and 
expenditure, could result in overconsumption. Some 
apps are designed for continuous engagement, which 
may encourage compulsive logging. If you choose to 
count, do it within a healthy, balanced diet and listen 
to your body’s hunger cues.

Weighing yourself is a simple way to monitor your 
behavior and make small adjustments to improve 
your energy balance (see pages 84–85). A research 
review indicated that daily weighing is associated 
with more weight loss than less frequent weighing. 
However, there are a number of reasons it’s best  
not to rely on the scale for measuring weight loss. 
WEIGHT VARIABLES
Your weight can fluctuate after just one meal, and 
2–6lb over a day. We’re often heavier in the evening 
after eating and drinking; salt, alcohol, medication, 
and menstruation can also cause water retention. 
One study found that weight is highest after the 
weekend and the ideal weigh-in time is Wednesday 
morning before consuming anything. If you want to 
establish a rough base weight, use the same scale, at 
the same time, without clothes. 
In addition, overreliance on the scale could 
contribute to an unhealthy body image and 
relationship with food, and for some people it  
can become a crutch.
WHAT DOESN’T THE SCALE TELL ME?
Be mindful that a weight reading doesn’t reflect  
how much body fat you are carrying, your overall 
body composition, or how healthy you are. Even if 
the number on the scale isn’t falling, you could still 
be losing body fat, gaining muscle, sleeping better, 
and improving your gut health (see pages 48–51). 
So-called smart scales claim to measure body fat 
by sending a tiny electrical current through the body. 
Unfortunately, it’s not that simple; for example, if 
you are dehydrated, these can overestimate the 
amount of body fat. Most research conducted has 
concluded that they aren’t accurate. 
CAN I RELY ON THE SCALE?
If you’re trying to lose weight, stepping onto the scale feels  
like a moment of truth. But the number doesn’t show what’s actually  
happening in your body.

ARE MEALTIMES  
IMPORTANT?
Whether it’s making time for breakfast in the morning or sitting down  
with family to eat dinner in the evening, research suggests that when and  
how we eat affects both our mental and physical health.
A number of studies have shown that it is healthier 
to eat meals at the same time each day. Evidence 
suggests that a regular meal pattern that includes 
eating breakfast, having 2–3 meals a day, and 
consuming a greater proportion of your daily energy 
intake earlier on in the day may have physiological 
benefits such as reduced inflammation and improved 
stress resistance. Regular mealtimes provide a sense 
of rhythm and familiarity, which can have real 
psychological benefits.
Breakfast
A RECENT STUDY LOOKING AT IRREGULAR 
BREAKFAST EATING FOUND THAT THOSE  
AGED BETWEEN 13–18 YEARS WERE THE  
MOST LIKELY TO SKIP BREAKFAST, 
with 22 percent of participants in this age group 
consuming breakfast on 2 days or fewer out of 4. 
Previous studies have suggested that differences  
in family structure, ethnicity, socioeconomic 
status, time constraints, and lack of food 
enjoyment can all influence this.
Appetite and energy expenditure follow the 
circadian rhythm, the natural “body clock” that 
regulates when we wake, sleep, and many things in 
between. At the same time, the timing of your meals 
may have an effect on your circadian rhythm. 
Personalizing your mealtimes to align with your 
sleep cycle can improve health and limit weight gain.
MAKING THE MOST OF MEALTIMES
Aim to eat sitting at a table and upright in a  
chair. This position allows your stomach to empty, 
helping digestion. It also encourages us to eat more 
mindfully (see pages 206–207) and notice feelings  
of satiety and fullness (see page 104).Even better is 
sitting down to eat with friends or family for some 
social interaction. Having a conversation during a 
meal slows down the speed at which you eat, 
meaning you are more likely to notice feelings of 
fullness before overeating. Conversely, eating dinner 
in front of the television not only eliminates the 
opportunity for social interaction but also distracts 
us from what we are eating, with research suggesting 
this can cause us to eat more than we need.

IS SNACKING  
BAD FOR YOU?
Snacking is an often-vilified habit, but it can be practiced  
in a way that helps, rather than hinders, good nutrition.
It is extremely common to snack between meals, 
with reports finding that 94 percent of people in  
the US and 66 percent in the UK do so at least  
once a day. Snacking is not in itself bad for you; it 
can help maintain energy levels, especially during 
busy days, and prevent you from feeling so hungry 
that you overeat.
However, snacking can become a habit and even 
start to replace meals, which is never a good thing, 
since your body cannot get all the nutrients you 
need just from small snacks. Many people snack  
due to boredom, a form of hedonic hunger  
(see page 104). Eating simply for pleasure is not 
necessarily a bad thing; after all, food is more than 
just fuel. But if you choose foods such as cookies, 
sweets, and cake, which are high in sugar and fat,  
or snack frequently throughout the day, you may  
be consuming more than your body needs.  
On top of this, the snack-food industry 
often uses disingenuous marketing. 
While individually wrapped snack 
bars may be convenient, especially 
when you are on the go, many of 
these contain high quantities of 
sugar, despite being marketed as a 
“healthy” option (see pages 62–63).
There is no need to avoid certain 
foods altogether when it comes to snacks, 
but the best policy is “everything in moderation.” 
Snacking mindfully (see pages 206–207) and 
choosing healthy, balanced options is a good idea,  
as this will prevent blood sugar spikes (see pages 
202–203) and keep you fuller for longer.
A modern trend
ONE REPORT FOUND THAT MILLENNIALS  
(THOSE AGED 21–38) ARE MORE LIKELY TO  
SNACK THAN OLDER GENERATIONS. 
Almost a quarter of this age group were found to 
snack at least four times a day, with a significant 
proportion of those questioned snacking to deal 
with boredom or stress.

WHY DO I FEEL HUNGRY  
ALL THE TIME?
It may be because of the simple reason that you need to eat  
more food! Or perhaps you are misinterpreting your body’s signals.  
Hunger is a much-misunderstood phenomenon.
We’ve all experienced hunger—the sensation your 
body produces when you are in need of fuel and 
nourishment. Satiety refers to feeling full, while 
satiation refers to feeling satisfied. 
Hormones control the balance between hunger 
and satiety, and what you eat affects the balance of 
those hormones. Food makes changes to levels of gut 
hormones, which in turn impacts the metabolites in 
the blood and the signals they transmit in the body.
TYPES OF HUNGER
Homeostatic hunger refers to the physical feeling  
of wanting to eat, caused by the need for energy  
(see opposite). Hedonic hunger describes the desire 
to eat for pleasure. When we smell or eat something 
tasty, the brain releases pleasure hormones like 
dopamine. We then associate that food with the 
feeling of pleasure we experienced, making us  
want to eat it again, or eat more of it than we need.
Psychological and emotional factors affect the 
balance between hunger hormones in ways we  
don’t yet fully understand. Tiredness can also  
have an impact (see pages 142–143). The human  
body has a complex system of hormones that 
interact in myriad ways. For example, cortisol,  
a stress hormone, suppresses appetite, but in  
cases of chronic stress, it can enhance appetite.  
MANAGING PERSISTENT HUNGER
It seems as we age, we lose connection with our 
innate hunger signals. For instance, people easily 
confuse thirst for hunger. Fighting against feeling 
hungry can do more harm than good, but it’s good  
to recognize and acknowledge whether your body is 
actually in need of fuel or if your hunger is actually 
for the pleasure you associate with food. 
If you feel tired and your stomach is growling, it’s 
likely your body lacks energy and you need to refuel 
to satiety. If this happens often, eat a little more at 
mealtimes, consider increasing your carbohydrate 
intake, or take a snack with you when out and about.
If it’s hedonic hunger that you keep feeling, it’s 
likely you’re in need of satiation. Research suggest 
some types of food can be more satiating than others. 
A diet rich in fiber or high in protein suppresses 
ghrelin (the hunger hormone) effectively.
AVOID "I’VE BLOWN IT!" MENTALITY
A destructive pattern emerges with excessive hunger 
when you give up fighting it and continue to eat 
beyond the point of fullness, out of a tangled blend 
of conflicting feelings like desire, guilt, frustration, 
and fulfillment. If you are struggling to detect your 
internal cues, try mindful eating and intuitive eating 
(see pages 208–211). Minimize distractions while 
eating. For example, turn off the TV.
A satiating square of chocolate after dinner is fine, 
but if you find yourself overeating or eating out of 
boredom, step back and take a moment to listen to 
your body and consider whether you are actually 
hungry. Often the craving will pass. Distract  
yourself from the feeling with a different activity.
Chewing food for longer may help you eat less 
during the meal and feel more satiated afterward.

CAN MY GUT BACTERIA  
HELP ME LOSE WEIGHT?
Research suggests that the gut microbiome—the trillions of bacteria  
that reside in our gut—may be an influential factor in our  
ability to lose weight.
Fascination with the gut microbiome has grown in 
recent years, as research has revealed the importance 
of its diversity on physical and mental health.  
Gut bacteria are involved in many bodily systems, 
including immunity, hunger, and digestion (see  
pages 48–53 and 140–141). Like our genetic makeup,  
no two people have the same composition of gut 
bacteria, and studies have uncovered a link between 
microbiome variation and body composition.
THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY
One study placed 26 participants on a low-calorie 
diet rich in fruit and vegetables and found that  
some people lost more weight than others. Analysis 
showed this was likely due to a difference in their 
gut bacteria, which could influence how efficiently 
food was broken down and thus how much weight 
was lost. In another study, researchers analyzed the 
gut bacteria of 169 obese and 123 nonobese adults  
and found that 23 percent of those who had lower 
diversity of bacteria were more likely to be obese,  
and had increased inflammatory markers, insulin 
resistance, and lipid levels, all of which increase  
the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Such effects occur because the types and diversity 
of the bacteria in our microbiome can impact how 
we process food, as well as other biochemical 
reactions, thereby influencing weight loss. These 
differences are likely due to a combination of 
genetics and environment. For instance, the most 
heritable bacterial species, Christensenellaceae, is 
found more predominantly in lean people and has 
been shown to protect against weight gain in rats.  
We can increase our gut microbiota diversity by 
consuming a varied, predominantly plant-based  
diet that is rich in fiber and by trying probiotic 
fermented foods, as well as limiting our use of 
unnecessary antibiotics and medications. However, 
more research is needed to confirm just how much  
of an impact our gut bacteria can have on weight 
loss. As yet, there is no definition of what a healthy 
gut microbiome should look like, beyond diversity.

CAN LIQUID FOODS HELP  
ME LOSE WEIGHT?
Meal replacement shakes and soups are portion- and calorie-controlled drinks that 
are consumed in place of meals or snacks in weight-loss programs. These products 
are often hailed as rapid weight-loss methods, but is there any truth in these claims?
For some, liquid meals help kick-start weight  
loss, but research suggests they are effective only  
in the short term. They are not recommended for 
long-term use. In fact, the potentially tricky return 
to solid foods increases the chance of weight gain.
THE PROS
Research into liquid meals shows some positive 
results. Participants who restricted their oral intake 
to about 800 calories per day on a liquid diet achieved 
significant weight loss at 12 months. They had foods 
reintroduced after three to five months and still 
managed to maintain weight loss. So while liquid 
diets are unsustainable in the long term, they can 
help instigate behavior change when people realize 
that they can lose weight and experience positive 
benefits to their physical and mental well-being.
Meal-replacement products can be convenient  
for busy dieters and eliminate decision-making  
at mealtimes. Additionally, they are often fortified 
with micronutrients. Some (expensive) brands even  
claim to be more nutritious than the average meal!
Smoothies can be great 
on-the-go options. Having 
the occasional smoothie  
for breakfast or lunch  
can be convenient as  
well as nutritious.

================================================================================

THE CONS
Chewing enhances nutrient absorption. One study 
found that chewing almonds between 25 and 40 
times suppressed hunger and increased the body’s 
ability to absorb nutrients from the almonds. Those 
who don’t chew properly can experience digestive 
problems and end up snacking more later. The  
same is true for those relying on liquid meals. 
After relying on liquid meals for a period of time 
and achieving some weight loss, problems can arise 
when individuals return to eating regular meals. It  
is very easy to slip into old eating habits and regain 
the weight. This can be amplified by hormonal 
changes in the body following dietary restriction  
and a lowered metabolic rate (see pages 92–93). 
Liquid meals can instill a poor relationship with 
food (see pages 210–211). In addition, following a 
set diet plan can reduce an individual’s ability to 
Nutritious additions
WHEN MAKING SMOOTHIES AT HOME, YOU  
CAN SQUEEZE IN EVEN MORE NUTRITION AND 
REDUCE YOUR SUGAR INTAKE.
Many smoothies you buy will be fruit heavy. 
Manufacturers know that the sugars in the fruit 
make their products more palatable (see page 64). 
By making your own smoothies, you can increase 
the vegetable content. Try adding healthy fats, such 
as flaxseeds and avocado. You could also add some 
protein powder to help make your nutritious 
beverage more of a complete meal.
respond to internal hunger cues and skew  
feelings of satiety (see pages 104–105). This  
can make the transition back to solid food even 
harder. Lastly, but importantly, liquid meals take the 
enjoyment and social aspect out of eating. Enjoying 
meals with family and friends makes a significant 
contribution to your well-being.
HOMEMADE SOUPS AND SMOOTHIES
There’s nothing wrong with liquid foods alongside  
a balanced diet of solid foods. The odd smoothie 
isn’t such a bad idea. It’s an easy way to get a lot  
of nutrients into your diet, especially if you don’t  
enjoy eating fruits and vegetables (see Nutritious 
additions, below) or if you’ve lost your appetite  
and feel more comfortable drinking than eating. 
Make soups with lots of vegetables to add  
plenty of fiber into your diet.

SHOULD I CUT  
OR REDUCE CARBS?
Low carb diets, like Keto, Atkins, and Paleo, have gained much popularity  
in recent years, in large part due to the media coverage describing ‘‘low-carb’’  
or ‘‘no-carb’’ as the big secret to weight loss. This simply isn’t true.
Everyone’s carbohydrate needs vary depending on 
factors like age, sex, build, and activity levels. If  
you feel you consume more carbs than is right for 
your body, reducing to bring balance to your diet  
is sensible. That’s not the same as going low-carb.
In the media, and in some scientific literature, 
carbs are often dismissed as fattening. It’s true that 
society’s carbohydrate requirements have reduced 
due to less active lifestyles, yet carbs remain an 
important part of a balanced diet. Remember that 
Japan has one of the lowest obesity rates and one  
of the highest rates of carbohydrate consumption!  
FLUID LOSS
Energy from carbs (in the form of glucose) can be 
converted to glycogen molecules and stored along 
with the water needed to reconvert it to glucose for 
future use. On a low-carb diet, the body makes fewer 
glycogen stores, so the corresponding water is absent. 
This sudden weight loss is often confused for fat loss.
LOW-CARB DIETS
Low-carb diets advocate the elimination or marked 
reduction of carbs such as grains (pasta, rice, and 
breads), starchy fruits and vegetables, and legumes. 
The glycogen weight-loss illusion
Each gram of glycogen (stored glucose) is  
stored with 3g water. The elimination of this 
water when glycogen stores are depleted on a 
low-carb diet is often confused for loss of fat.
Carbs are broken down during 
digestion, releasing glucose  
into the bloodstream.
DIGEST CARBS 
Excess glucose is converted to 
glycogen and stored in the liver and 
muscles alongside water, at a ratio  
of 1 part glycogen to 3 parts water.
STORE GLYCOGEN
The water is used to reconvert 
glycogen to glucose when energy is 
needed. The glucose is released into 
the bloodstream along with the water.

Studies show there is no significant difference 
in weight loss between low-carb and low-fat diets. 
While studies reveal a reduction in weight on 
the ketogenic diet, it is not sustained long term. 
These studies have a high dropout rate, showing 
just how difficult it is to stick to a low-carb diet.
Carbs offer many health benefits (see page 12). 
If you suddenly restrict them, you may 
experience headaches and digestive symptoms 
such as constipation. The fiber in carbs has 
several benefits, including improving digestion

and maintaining blood sugar levels. The keto 
diet, which excludes many fruits and vegetables, 
may cause constipation, and keto dieters can miss 
out on the long-term health benefits of 
nourishing their gut bacteria (see pages 48–53).
Restricting carbs can cause fatigue, low mood, 
and cravings. It’s not recommended for those 
recovering from an eating disorder or disordered 
eating (see pages 210–211), or for children.
MACRONUTRIENT IMBALANCE
Restricting any food group can result in 
nutritional deficiency. When we remove or restrict 
carbs, we may turn to other macronutrients to fill 
the gap. Dietary proteins and fats may increase 
to unhealthy levels, which may reduce feelings 
of hunger to help with weight loss but cause 
other issues such as increased cholesterol. 
Research found young healthy adults following 
a low-carb, high-fat diet had a 44 percent 
increase in LDL (“bad”) cholesterol (see page 
17). Keto diets encourage foods high in fat, but 
if you don’t differentiate between saturated and 
unsaturated fats, your LDL cholesterol levels 
could easily rise, increasing your risk for heart 
disease and stroke.
Glycogen stored in the liver is used 
first. The water used to convert it to 
glucose travels via the bloodstream 
to the kidneys to be expelled as urine.
STORES IN LIVER
Once the liver’s glycogen supply is 
depleted, the body relies on the 
glycogen stores in the muscles.
STORES IN MUSCLE
When you cut carbs, your body 
depletes glycogen stores, releasing 
stored water. It’s the loss of this,  
(not fat) that shows on the scales.

people with type 2 diabetes who would like

professional to support any necessary changes 
to relevant diabetes medications and monitor 
blood glucose and the risk of hypoglycemia  
(see pages 170–173).

WHAT IS A DETOX DIET  
AND DETOX TEA?
"Detox" is a buzzword in the diet industry. Many products and diet plans promise  
to rid the body of toxins, help you lose weight, and even reduce cellulite. But detoxes are 
unnecessary, because your body has a highly effective detoxification system of its own.
they impose. These restrictions may also leave you  
feeling deprived and probably hungry, which may 
lead to subsequent overeating.
The bottom line is that detox diets are not good 
for weight loss and are a serious no-go in terms of 
nutrition. No health professional would recommend 
a detox diet because you do not need to detox.
DETOX TEAS
The “teatox” has gained much attention on social 
media recently, with many people making sensational 
claims of weight loss. It is entirely possible that you 
may lose weight in the short term on any new diet 
regime, but there is no scientific evidence to support 
the notion that drinking tea will help you lose weight. 
Detox teas or “skinny” teas have hit the headlines 
with claims of being able to help you lose weight 
fast without dieting by sending your metabolism 
into overdrive. You can see the allure!
The truth is, we don’t need to “cleanse” or detox 
ourselves at all, and following this sort of diet will 
not have this desired effect. 
The idea of feeling clean after a detox diet is what 
spurs dieters to embark repeatedly on expensive and 
immensely restrictive detox diets. We come into 
contact with environmental toxins every single day 
in the air we breathe and the food we eat, for instance. 
The body is a wonderful organism, which, through 
the action of the liver, effectively removes toxins and 
waste products that make it into the body system.  
It is possible that following one of these detox 
plans may lead to some weight loss, but most of  
that will be water loss (see pages 110–111) and will  
be regained when you return to eating normally. 
RISKS WITH NO REWARD
Over time, detox diets also give you a greater risk of 
nutrient deficiencies due to the dietary restrictions 
Detoxification by the liver 
During digestion, nutrient-laden 
blood from the small intestine is 
passed to the liver for processing. 
Cells in the liver called hepatocytes 
sift out nutrients and redirect them  
to wherever they are needed in the 
body. At the same time, hepatocytes 
break down toxins and send the  
waste on to be excreted.
The liver receives  
blood via the  
hepatic portal vein.

EXCRETED IN URINE
Via the bladder  Some toxins are 
sent in the blood to the kidneys, 
then on to the bladder to be 
excreted as urine.
EXCRETED IN FECES
Via the bowel  Waste is returned 
via the gallbladder to the small 
intestine and eventually leaves  
the body in feces.
In reality, teatoxes can be dangerous and are not 
recommended. Some products are simply laxatives 
in tea form. The key ingredient is senna, which is 
used to treat constipation. It irritates the stomach 
lining to stimulate bowel movements and acts as a 
diuretic. Using senna can cause dehydration, cramps, 
and diarrhea and result in inadequate nutrient 
absorption, causing depletion of key minerals  
such as calcium, sodium, and potassium. 
Regular or prolonged use of senna can  
damage the gut lining and disrupt electrolyte 
balance, potentially causing heart damage. 
The loss of bulk caused by using a laxative  
to “clear out” can make you feel and look 
slimmer in the short term, due to your bowels 
being abnormally empty. But it has no impact 
on fat loss, because calories from food are 
absorbed in your small intestine (see page 28), 
much further up the digestive tract than  
the colon, which is where the effect of the 
laxative is felt. So with skinny teas, you  
end up spending a fortune on something  
that, basically, confines you to the toilet! 

================================================================================

IS IT OK TO SKIP MEALS? 
It sounds simple: skip a meal or two here and there, and you will be able to lose 
weight without having to worry too much about what you’re actually eating.  
But is it that easy—and could it even be potentially harmful? 
Intermittent fasting (IF) is a weight-loss 
method that has grown in popularity in recent 
years. There are three main types: 
  Whole-day fasting: this includes the well-
known 5:2 diet, with a limited 400–500 calorie 
intake on two days of the week only.
  Alternate-day fasting: on fasted days,  
it’s recommended you eat just one meal.
  Time-restricted eating: an example is the 
16:8 plan, where you eat the same amount of 
food as usual, but during an eight-hour window 
each day. Often, followers opt to skip breakfast.
Time-restricted eating
This method typically takes advantage of our natural 
fasting period of sleep by setting an evening cutoff 
for eating. Here is an example of a daily schedule 
based on 16 hours of fasting.

Most of the research surrounding IF is based on 
simple calorie restriction. Most likely, these diets 
are popular because they offer a straightforward 
way to reduce energy intake that often leads to 
weight loss. For example, many people following 
time-restricted eating “fast” while asleep, then 
eat fewer calories than they normally would 
because they also have a shorter time period 
within which to eat. However, IF won’t work  
for everyone, such as those with a tendency  
to comfort or binge eat, rather than stop  
when full (see pages 212–213).

those with obesity, but it’s unclear why this is 
the case, aside from simple calorie restriction. 
Be careful of skipping any meals, especially if 
your body clock means you’re naturally a person 
who wakes up hungry.
FASTING RISKS
More worryingly, the restriction inherent in IF 
could potentially lead to overeating, bingeing, 
or even eating disorders. Skipping meals is also 
a difficult practice to sustain. There is actually 
some evidence that IF can lower risk factors for 
diabetes and heart disease, but research in this 
area is still in its infancy. Sustained, healthy 
weight loss involves many factors, including  
a diet that’s balanced, varied, and enjoyable, 
good quality sleep, physical activity, and stress 
management. There is no need to adopt weight 
loss diets that disrupt your normal routine.
SKIPPING BREAKFAST
Breakfast appears to be especially important 
when maintaining a healthy weight. Research 
suggests that controlling food intake 
across the day is more 
manageable on a full stomach 
in the morning—people who 
eat breakfast appear to be 
more likely to maintain 
weight loss in the long term. 
If you are considering 
adopting any type of IF, 
breakfast may not be your 
best choice of meal to 
miss. There is some 
evidence that skipping 
the first meal

WHAT DOES PLANT-BASED 
ACTUALLY MEAN?
"Plant-based" has become a trendy term, but it isn’t always clear what  
exactly people mean by it. Does it mean eating more plants, or just plants?  
And how does it differ from being vegan or vegetarian?
Plant-based eating is becoming increasingly  
popular, with a total of 57 percent of US households 
purchasing plant-based food in 2020, up from  
53 percent in 2019. As the trend grows, so do 
misunderstandings of its original meaning.
As you might expect, a plant-based diet focuses 
on foods primarily from plants. This includes not 
only fruits and vegetables but also nuts, seeds, oils, 
whole grains, and legumes. It doesn’t mean that you 
are vegetarian or vegan and never eat meat or dairy. 
Instead, you are proportionately choosing more of 
your foods from plant sources.
A well-planned plant-based diet can support 
healthy living at every age and life stage. Including  
a wide variety of healthy whole foods will ensure 
your diet is balanced and sustainable. However, like 
all diets, a poorly planned plant-based diet may leave 
you at risk of certain nutrient deficiencies, which 
may affect both the mind and body.
VEGANISM
Veganism is more than just a dietary choice; it 
encompasses a way of life in which the aim is to 
exclude cruelty to animals in all forms and for 
sustainability and environmental reasons. This 
means vegans avoid using animal or animal-derived 
products in food or clothing or for any other purpose.
It can be very easy to use a product or consume a 
food that isn’t vegan if you don’t know what to look 
for on the label. Animal-derived ingredients crop up 
in all sorts of places, such as food additives in bread, 
gelatin products, some fruit juices, and lanolin-
derived vitamin D in cereals or supplements 
(vitamin D2 and lichen-derived vitamin D3 are 
suitable for vegans).
Veganism is often hailed as a healthy way to live, 
but it’s possible to be an unhealthy vegan. You could 
keep to a vegan diet yet eat fast foods and processed 
ready-made meals, use saturated-fat-rich coconut oil 
in your cooking, and enjoy high-sugar foods such as 
vegan chocolate brownies. Veganism itself won’t 
necessarily give you the nutrients you need for  
good health and energy (see pages 130–131).
VEGETARIANISM
Vegetarianism has been around for centuries and is 
becoming increasingly popular. Vegetarians don’t eat 
fish, meat, or chicken, including stock and fat from 
animals, insects and gelatin, or animal rennet. A diet 
can include vegetables and fruits, grains and 
legumes, nuts and seeds, eggs, dairy products, and 
honey. There are also a number of different 
subcategories of vegetarianism:
  Lacto-ovo vegetarians eat dairy foods and eggs 
but not meat, poultry, or seafood.
  Ovo-vegetarians include eggs but avoid all other 
animal foods, including dairy.
  Lacto-vegetarians eat dairy foods but exclude 
eggs, meat, poultry, and seafood.
Ultimately, plant-based eating should be about 
eating meals with more vegetables and legumes and 
swapping animal-derived produce for plant protein 
alternatives such as beans, legumes, and tofu.

Plant-based combinations  
Instead of comprising a rigid set of rules, a 
plant-based diet can mean a variety of dietary 
combinations, including or excluding animal-
derived products as desired but predominantly 
featuring foods from plant sources.

WHAT ARE THE HEALTH 
BENEFITS OF PLANT-BASED 
NUTRITION?
The idea that vegetables are good for us is one of the most obvious principles of 
nutrition. In fact, there are many reasons why increasing the proportion of plants  
in your diet can improve your health.
There are numerous benefits to following a plant-
based diet, including reduced environmental impact 
and lower costs. There can also be significant health 
benefits, provided you avoid nutritional deficiencies.
YOUR NUTRITIONAL NEEDS
The dietary guidelines for Americans recommends  
a diet low in saturated fat and high in whole grains, 
fresh fruits, and vegetables. If you follow a balanced 
vegetarian diet based on whole grains, legumes, 
vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds, you should easily 
exceed the guidelines for eating five portions of 
fruits or vegetables a day, and your meals will be 
naturally high in fiber and low in saturated fat.
Things are more complicated when it comes to 
the essential vitamins and minerals that your body 
needs on a daily basis, like calcium, iron, omega-3 
fatty acids, and iodine, as well as vitamin B12. It is 
easy to get enough of these when following a 
omnivorous diet, but some of these nutrients are less 
“bio-available” in plant-based foods, meaning it is 
more difficult for the body to use those nutrients 
A balanced vegan diet
The key to a healthy vegan diet is 
making sure all your nutritional needs 
are met once animal products have been 
eliminated. This may mean adjusting 
your intake of certain foods to achieve a 
varied and balanced mix of protein, 
fiber, vitamins, minerals, and healthy 
fats that will leave you feeling energized 
and strong. Aim to match the daily and 
weekly amounts recommended here.

when you eat the foods. It is important to make sure  
you are getting the right amount of protein and 
micronutrients from your diet (see pages 128–131).
THE POWER OF PLANTS
A lot of research supports the argument that a plant-
based diet increases longevity and reduces the risk of 
certain health conditions. Well-balanced plant-based 
diets that are low in saturated fats can contribute 
toward managing a healthy weight, reducing your  
risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and 
even some cancers. There is also a lot of evidence  
that points toward reduced blood pressure when 
omitting animal products from our diets.
Fiber is an important factor in why plant-based 
eating is beneficial to health. Eating a variety of 
plant-based foods may help you get the recommended 
28g of fiber each day, which supports the gut 
microbiome. Prebiotic foods (see pages 52–53), including 
garlic, leeks, bananas, and oats, are particularly effective 
in this regard. Studies show that eating a high-fiber 
diet can lead to better control of blood-sugar levels and 
cholesterol levels, too. And fiber from whole grains has 
also been linked to a reduced risk of developing several 
diseases, including type 2 diabetes.
There are healthy and happy people who eat animal 
products and healthy and happy people who eat only 
plants. By reducing meat, fish, and dairy to minimal 
amounts and increasing plant-based alternatives, you 
can get the best of both worlds and lessen your 
environmental impact. While this approach does not 
address the ethical concerns associated with animal 
products, it may be a huge step for someone who 
consumes meat, fish, and dairy daily in their diet.

================================================================================

IS PLANT-BASED  
ALWAYS HEALTHIER?
The benefits of a primarily plant-based diet, while good, are dependent on whether  
it is followed for optimal health. Without careful choices, plant-based has the 
potential to be full of unhealthy items and there is a risk of nutritional deficiencies.
Debates over our diets are often highly emotive. The 
conversation around plant-based eating often focuses 
on personal preference and environmental and ethical 
concerns, while nutritional science gets left behind.
FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE
The nutritional benefits of eating more plants are 
grounded in solid evidence. A diverse range of plant 
foods providing 28g of fiber each day supports gut 
health, while fruits and vegetables are great sources 
for a range of vitamins and minerals.
However, some plant-based diets risk not getting 
the right nutrition through protein, vitamin, and 
mineral intake. These risks can be overcome by 
choosing the right vegetarian foods and, when 
necessary, supplements (see pages 128–131).

For example, soy, quinoa, and nuts are good sources 
of protein, and tofu, lentils, and spinach are good 
sources of iron. But some nutrients are trickier to 
get. Iodine, for instance, is mostly found in dairy 
products and fish. The iodine content of plant foods 
depends on the iodine content of the soil, which is 
variable. Foods grown closer to the ocean tend to  
be higher in iodine. Where soils are iodine deficient, 
iodized salt and seaweed can provide iodine.
The way vegetables are cooked is also relevant: 
steamed vegetables are far more nutritious than 
deep-fried, for instance. And a lot of plant-based 
alternatives to animal products are not nutritionally 
balanced. For example, pulled pork is often replaced 
by jackfruit, but the latter contains no protein. 
There are also many vegan processed foods available 
that are unhealthy—vegetarian sausage rolls, for 
instance, can be high in salt and saturated fat.
QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED
Contrary to what most research suggests, there is 
some research indicating that plant-based diets may 
contribute to cardiovascular disease. A two-decade 
UK-based study of 50,000 people analyzed the risk 
of stroke and other health problems based on diet. 
The researchers found that, compared with meat 
eaters, rates of heart disease (such as angina or heart 
attack) were 13 percent lower in pescatarians and 22 
percent lower in vegetarians. But the results also 
showed that rates of stroke were 20 percent higher 
among vegetarians. This was mostly due to 
The “Anti-nutrient”
PHYTIC ACID IS PRESENT IN PLANT SEEDS SUCH 
AS NUTS, WHOLE GRAINS, AND BEANS.
In the body, the acid binds to minerals to form 
phytate, which is known as an "anti-nutrient" since 
it impairs the absorption of zinc, iron, and calcium 
and can cause deficiencies in those on a plant-
based diet. As an antioxidant that can help prevent 
cardiovascular disease and kidney stones, however, 
it also has health benefits, so avoiding these foods 
is not advised. Soaking, cooking, fermenting, and 
sprouting beans and grains will reduce their 
phytate content, while the minerals affected can 
also be sourced elsewhere: zinc in tofu; iron in 
dates and strawberries; calcium in leafy greens.
hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding into the brain),  
and was not observed among pescatarians.
Studies like this may sound groundbreaking,  
but it’s important to check their limitations.  
The overall risk of stroke in vegetarians was small, 
equal to 3 extra cases per 1,000 people over 10 years. 
What’s more, this particular study was observational, 
meaning the researchers did not account for other 
relevant variables besides diet.
There are many other factors to consider, but  
the more robust research suggests that plant-based 
diets, if conducted well, can be a healthy way of 
eating and that meat eaters don’t have to give up 
meat to be healthier—they can simply reduce it.

================================================================================

HOW CAN I EAT IN A 
SUSTAINABLE WAY?
Many people have this question on their minds at the moment, but it can be  
difficult to understand the issues involved. Be reassured that there are practical 
steps you can take with your diet to minimize your environmental impact.
It is more important than ever before that we take 
care of planet Earth. How we use natural resources 
for food production must become more sustainable 
for the sake of future generations and for overall 
harmony of life on the planet. 
The agriculture industry is the biggest driver of 
biodiversity vons (GHGe). Fossil fuels are used all 
along supply chains and beyond, from farming and 
production to distribution and delivery to waste 
disposal. We all have the power to make dietary 
changes, large or small, to contribute to solutions.
EAT LESS MEAT AND DAIRY
If you eat meat, you don’t need to give it up 
completely. Consider reducing your consumption  
of red meat to one portion per week. This change 
alone could make a difference.
Half of the habitable land on the planet is used  
for agriculture, with 77 percent of it dedicated to 
rearing livestock. Yet meat and dairy produce provide 
only 17 percent of global energy intake, and only  
33 percent of global protein intake. This resource-
intensive approach to food production isn’t paying 
off, either in terms of nutrition or sustainability. 
Meat and dairy production are responsible for 
two-thirds of the GHGe of the US’s food industry. 
Globally, countless ecosystems are destroyed to make 
space for grazing livestock or for raising feed crops 
for them. At this point, even the most dedicated 
meat eaters are choosing to lean more on plant-based 
sources of protein as a lifeline for the planet.
Going plant-based doesn’t mean eating no meat 
whatsoever. Try following the planetary diet (see 
page 127) as closely as possible. There are many

ways of using plant-based proteins (see pages 128–
129). Educate yourself on the key nutrients you need  
to include on a plant-based diet (see pages 130–131).
THINK LOGISTICS
Shopping locally and seasonally where possible  
will reduce the length of the supply chains  
involved in the food you eat, thereby reducing 
emissions. Do what you can to reduce food waste. 
Plan meals and snacks for the week ahead and shop 
accordingly to help you avoid buying excess 
perishable produce.
If you have produce that’s about to spoil, think 
about freezing it. Blanch vegetables and fruit before 
freezing them. Or cook up meals to freeze in 
portions for your later convenience.
Try growing your own, then pick just what you 
need. Herbs on a windowsill, a sack of potatoes on

Unsustainable factors Food waste is a major 
contributing factor making the food industry 
unsustainable. The consumer can have a big impact 
here. The majority of food waste takes place in the 
home, with 30–40 percent of the purchased food 
ending up in the trash. We must learn to treat foods as 
precious resources and do our best to prevent wastage.

IS PLANT-BASED BETTER  
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT?
Yes, definitely—although not all plant proteins are equal. To make the  
greatest impact with your plant-based dietary choices, it’s important  
to know which products have the smallest carbon footprint. 
When you factor in the impact of the meat and dairy 
industry (see page 124), a plant-based diet is inarguably 
the way forward. But most plant products have the 
edge over others. For instance, soy, a legume, fixes 
nitrogen into the soil as it grows, reducing the need 
for nitrogen fertilizers. These produce nitrous oxide, 
a potent greenhouse gas that leaks into waterways, 
causing damage to marine life and ecosystems. Soy 
also has a good nutritional profile, so leaning toward 
soy products alongside beans and lentils (for balance) 
is a sound environmental and nutritional choice.
Mycoprotein, an excellent protein source, is often 
mistakenly considered an unhealthy processed food. 
It is a plant-based food made from fungus and 
produced through fermentation. (You might 
recognize it by the brand name Quorn.) It has a 
significantly smaller carbon footprint than animal 
proteins and uses 90 per ent less land, making it  
a highly sustainable protein source.
FACTORING WATER USAGE
Water is becoming more scarce, especially in 
countries that produce most of our foods. The  
food industry accounts for 70 percent of water use. 
This is an important point to consider when using 
nuts as a protein source. The country of origin and

almonds is exceptionally water inefficient, using 
around 1.3 gallons of water per almond (Californian 
farmers have committed to reduce water usage).
THE PLANETARY DIET
The planetary diet is a useful practical guideline  
for helping you eat sustainably and can be adapted  
to meet a broad range of dietary needs and cultural 
preferences. This approach to balancing the diet 
takes into account both the environmental impact  
of food production and the nutritional requirements

of the human body. The focus is on whole produce, 
with half of the diet coming from vegetables and 
fruits. The other half consists primarily of whole 
grains and plant proteins (beans and lentils) but  
also includes fats, modest amounts of meat and dairy, 
and some added sugars and starchy vegetables. 
Different from a vegan or vegetarian diet, the 
planetary diet simply requires you to reduce the 
number of portions of meat you consume and get 
the bulk of your protein from plant sources. For red 
meat fans, you’re looking at a burger a week or a 
large steak a month. Or you could have a couple of 
portions of chicken and the same of fish per week.

WILL I STRUGGLE TO  
EAT ENOUGH PROTEIN  
ON A VEGAN DIET?
It’s a misconception that anyone adopting a vegan lifestyle will struggle to get enough 
protein. Plant proteins may be arranged differently from those in meat and fish, but a 
sufficiently varied vegan diet will supply more than enough to meet daily needs.
Protein is present in every cell and is fundamental 
for tissue repair, muscle growth, and more. The idea 
that a vegan diet is protein deficient derives from 
the fact that not all protein is “complete.” Protein’s 
building blocks are 20 amino acids, and the body has 
to obtain nine of these from diet; complete protein 
contains similar amounts of all nine. While meat, 
eggs, fish, and dairy provide complete protein, most 
plant-based foods are incomplete. For example, 
white and brown rice are high in methionine and

Europe and North America, it

the major source of protein. 
low in lysine, which is found in many pulses. So 
vegans should consume as many foods as possible. 
Previous research suggested it is necessary to 
combine incomplete proteins at each meal; now  
we know eating a mixture over the day is effective, 
because of how the liver stores amino acids. Also, 
the body can efficiently use up to only 20g–40g  
of protein at a time. Healthy adults should eat at 
least 0.8g per 2lb (1kg) of body weight daily—more, 
depending on activity levels (see pages 80–81).
PROTEIN SOURCES
Soy-based foods provide complete protein.  
Tofu (8g per 3.5oz) is the best known, while  
tempeh (18g) is a fermented meat substitute  
with a stronger flavor; soy-based milk and 
yogurt alternatives are also fermented. Other  
meat substitutes are mycoprotein (see opposite) 
and high-protein seitan (75g), which is made  
from wheat gluten so may not suit those with  
an intolerance.    
Quinoa (4.4g per 3.5oz) is another complete 
protein source. It is actually a seed from the

Chenopodium quinoa plant, although it’s usually 
grouped with whole grains. 
Otherwise, nuts and seeds are ideal for snacking, 
in salad or cereal, or in nut butters. They can  
contain up to 20g of protein per 3.5oz; a portion  
is around 1oz. Beans and lentils typically contain 
about 20g of protein per 3.5oz; one portion is  
around 4oz cooked. Fortified foods like vegan 
energy balls, breakfast cereals, and protein bars  
often have soy added. Check labels—“vegan”  
doesn’t mean a food is low in salt, sugar, and fat. 
Some vegetables also provide protein, for  
example, 2.8g per 3.5oz of broccoli. 
What is mycoprotein?
MYCOPROTEIN IS A MEAT SUBSTITUTE 
 BETTER KNOWN AS QUORN. 
Its main ingredient, Fusarium venenatum, is a 
microfungus that occurs naturally in soil—fungi 
aren’t classified as plants because they lack 
chlorophyll and have a different cellular structure. It 
is fed with carbohydrate in large fermenters and the 
liquid is separated by centrifugal force to create  
mycoprotein dough. A complete protein source (11g 
per 3.5oz), it also contains various micronutrients.

WHAT OTHER NUTRIENTS 
SHOULD PLANT-BASED 
EATERS CONSIDER?
Anyone who eats only certain animal-derived foods, or excludes them completely, 
should still be able to get most of the nutrients they need from a plant-based diet.  
In some cases, though, it may be necessary to supplement.
Most nutrients are abundant in a plant-based  
diet. Protein is often a concern but shouldn’t be  
a problem, whereas a vitamin D supplement is 
necessary for everyone in winter (see pages 138–
139). These are some key micronutrients to consider.
As well as ensuring strong bones and teeth, 
calcium regulates muscle contractions and helps 
blood clot normally. Dairy is a key source; only  
some plants contain calcium, at fairly low levels. 
Even mild iodine deficiency can harm a baby’s 
developing brain. It also affects levels of thyroid 
hormones, which support metabolic function.  
Plant sources are scarce, so those at higher risk, in 
particular pregnant or breastfeeding women, should 
consider supplementing. Talk to your doctor first. 
Heart and brain-friendly omega-3 fatty acids 
can be obtained only from diet (see pages 16–17). 
ALA (alpha-linolenic-acid) is available in various 
plant sources, but research indicates plants are less 
effective sources of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and 
docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. EPA and DHA  
can be taken as microalgae-based supplements.
Vitamin B12 keeps nerve and blood cells healthy. 
Most plant-based sources can’t be processed by the 
body, although you can sprinkle nutritional yeast on 
meals or take a daily supplement. Ask your primary 
care physician to periodically check your B12 levels.
Iron helps maintain the immune system and form 
hemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the 
body. Deficiency can lead to anemia (below-average 
intake is prevalent among young children and women 
of reproductive age). Vitamin C aids iron absorption. 
The body doesn’t make zinc, which helps make 
cells and enzymes and processes fat, protein, and 
carbohydrates; 30g of hemp or pumpkin seeds 
provides a third of daily adult needs.

OXALATES AND PHYTATES
While plant foods are healthy, some can have  
less beneficial elements—another reason to  
eat a wide variety. For example, spinach  
and Swiss chard contain oxalates, an  
acid that reduces calcium absorption. 
Various beans, whole grain cereals, 
nuts, and seeds (including almonds, 
sesame seeds, and lentils) contain 
compounds called phytates, which 
inhibit zinc and iron absorption. 
Soaking before eating, or adding

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO 
INCREASE PLANT-BASED 
DIVERSITY?
There is a lot of buzz around the subject of gut health these days, in particular  
the positive impact a diverse plant-based diet can have on the gut. This isn’t 
just a health fad—there’s good research to support it.
It is widely accepted that we have a healthier gut  
if we have a diverse range of different gut bacteria, 
which carry out many important functions that 
benefit our health. In the gut, we have trillions of 
microorganisms that are collectively referred to  
as the gut microbiota (see pages 48–49). What we  
eat affects the composition of these bacteria.
Research shows that greater gut microbe diversity 
is associated with better health. One study of over 
10,000 stool samples found that those who eat more 
than 30 types of plant-based foods per week had more 
diverse gut microbes than those eating less than 10.
A large study of more than 20,000 people found  
a strong association between a diet high in plant 
foods and bowel movement frequency. Chronic 
constipation can have a serious negative effect on 
your health, so staying “regular” is another benefit  
of being on a largely plant-based diet.
EXPERIMENTATION AND FAMILIARITY
Consuming a diverse plant-based diet helps you 
increase your microbiota diversity. Aim to eat more 
fruits and vegetables than you normally do—most 
people don’t get enough. Experiment with beans  
and legumes you don’t usually use. Remember that 
plant-based includes whole grains, nuts, and seeds. 
When it comes to your macronutrient 
requirements (see page 10), become familiar  
with the types of plant-based protein, fat, and 
carbohydrate sources available. Plant-based carbs  
can be an excellent source of fiber (see pages 18  
and 44), which is important for feeding and 
maintaining your microbiota.
Plant-based proteins can be combined to provide 
your full protein requirements (see pages 14–15). 
Aim to include a variety of fruits and vegetables in 
your diet. Don’t opt for the same things every day.

CAN I EAT TO BOOST IMMUNITY?
The immune system is incredibly complex and acts like a surveillance system to 
recognize and respond to pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins. Our food 
choices could help, or hinder, its ability to defend the body.
“Boosting” immunity is a marketing concept to 
promote supplements; in fact, our immune system  
is programmed to work in a highly specific way.  
Diet can support it to function at its best when 
under attack and to maintain a protective barrier.
Our immune system is always “on,” but when 
activated, it needs additional energy to fuel the 
creation of millions of new immune cells to fight the 
threat. Poor diet can contribute to weakened immune 
response, as can gut health and antibiotic use (see 
pages 140–141). Healthy adults should be able to 
obtain enough of the micronutrients that support 
immune function from a balanced and varied diet. 
Plant-based eaters may need to supplement certain 
nutrients (see pages 130–131); otherwise, it shouldn’t 
be necessary unless medically advised and could 
even cause health problems. If you feel your immune 
system isn’t working well, or you eat a restricted 
diet, talk to your primary care physician (PCP).
KEY MICRONUTRIENTS
Aim to regularly eat foods containing these vitamins 
and minerals. (RDAs are based on US guidelines.) 
  Vitamin A supports production of immune cells; 
a deficiency can increase susceptibility to infections. 
(RDA age 14–51+: men 900mcg RAE, women 
700mcg RAE)
  Vitamin B6 is involved in producing immune 
cells and processing of antibodies. B9 (folate) and 
B12 are important for red blood cell function; B12 
is also involved in immune cell synthesis. Vegans 
may need to supplement B12. (RDA: B6, men age 
14–50: 1.3mg, age 51+: 1.7mg; women age 14–18: 
1.2mg, age 19–50: 1.3mg, age 51+: 1.5mg; Folate, 
The immune response 
Two key immune responses work 
together. The natural response  
quickly tries to stop the pathogen  
from spreading, while the slower  
adaptive response  requires exposure  
to the pathogen first then learns to 
identify it rapidly.
Different types of white blood 
cells patrol or wait to be 
alerted. Many types play a 
role in both stages of the 
immune response.

  Vitamin C protects cells and maintains skin, 
bones, and blood vessels. There’s conflicting 
evidence on whether it reduces the risk of catching 
viruses. (RDA age 19+: men 40mg, women 75mg)
  Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with a 
reduced immune response (see pages 138–139).
  Vitamin E deficiency is linked to an increased

SHOULD I TRY TO GET MORE 
VITAMIN D FROM MY DIET?
Vitamin D is essential for healthy teeth, bones, and muscle, but did you know it’s 
technically a hormone? Unlike every other vitamin, we make vitamin D ourselves 
simply by the action of sunlight directly on skin, although we may need supplements.
Anyone not living at a high latitude should be  
able to get enough UVB light exposure to meet all 
their vitamin D needs in spring and summer, from 
about 15 minutes outside daily with legs or forearms 
exposed. (Cloud cover and broad spectrum sun 
protection may reduce exposure.) From October  
to March, the sun is too weak in the northern 
hemisphere for us to make enough vitamin D,  
so we need other sources to maintain our levels. 
Only a few foods contain the two main forms  
of vitamin D: D2 (ergocalciferol) is plant based  
and found in fortified milks, cereals, and 
mushrooms. Oily fish and fish oils are good sources 
of D3 (cholecalciferol); one tablespoon of cod liver 
oil contains around 30mcg (micrograms), while 
other animal sources contain lower levels. 
Vitamin D3
Vitamin D from sunshine is inert and the 
body converts it into a biologically active 
form in a two-stage process. 
HOW MUCH DO I NEED?
Vitamin D’s interaction with other nutrients enables 
us to build and maintain healthy bones and muscles, 
for example, by helping the body to absorb and 
conserve calcium. According to US health guidelines, 
most people 14-70 years old need 15mcg/600IU and 
people 71+ need 20mcg/800IU; since it can be 
difficult to obtain this much from diet, a 10mcg 
supplement may be necessary between October  
and March. People who get little or no sun exposure, 
those with darker skin, and children under five 
should consider supplementing vitamin D, based on 
blood lab levels. Because breast milk has low levels  
of vitamin D, breastfed babies and those consuming 
less than 17oz of formula (which is fortified) should 
be given an 8.5mcg supplement daily. 
Vitamin D is found in many body tissues and may 
have multiple health impacts; a deficiency has been 
linked to inflammation and an increased risk of weight 
gain and diabetes. More positively, recent studies have 
identified potential benefits for female and male 
fertility and found that women with sufficient levels  
of vitamin D are less likely to miscarry.

DOES GUT HEALTH 
PLAY A ROLE IN 
IMMUNE RESPONSE?
While a lot remains unknown with regards to the relationship between the immune 
system and the gut, scientists have found some highly important links.
Research indicates that as much as 70 percent of  
our immune system resides in the gastrointestinal 
tract, including 80 percent of the body’s IgA 
antibody-producing plasma cells. This may seem 
surprising until you consider that the digestive tract 
is the site within our bodies that receives the most 
day-to-day contact with external elements, mainly 
food and helpful gut bacteria but also pathogens  
and toxic substances. Not only are immune cells  
in the gut able to mount a defense against such 
harmful “foreign bodies,” uniquely, they are also  
able to distinguish such invaders from the similarly 
“foreign” but needful array of nutrients in food  
and the microbiome of beneficial gut bacteria. 
CRITICAL ROLE OF GUT BACTERIA
Scientists are also discovering how seeding of  
the gut microbiome helps ensure healthy 
development of the immune system in babies  
and infants. Evidence suggests gut bacteria play  
a key role in stimulating an expansion of intestinal 
immune cells; in the proper functioning of antibody 
secretion; and in achieving balance between the  
two groups of T helper cells—white blood cells  
that activate most other immune cells. 
IMMUNE-RELATED DISORDERS
T helper cells divide into two groups: Th1 and Th2. 
We are born with more Th2, and bacteria colonizing 
the gut of newborns is needed to achieve a healthy 
balance between Th1 and Th2. A failure to achieve 
that balance, with a bias towards Th2 cells, is linked 
to the development of allergies. Hence some scientists 
theorize that poor development of infant gut bacteria 
could be at the root of an increasing incidence in the 
West of allergies and conditions that can be triggered 
by allergic reaction, such as asthma and eczema. 
The link between allergies, autoimmune diseases, 
and the immune system is complex. In allergies, the 
immune system recognizes harmless non-invaders  
as harmful. In autoimmune diseases, such as celiac 
disease and rheumatoid arthritis, the body attacks  
its own tissues. There is growing evidence that 
composition of gut microbiota has an impact on the 
risk of developing these immune-related disorders. 
All this need not mean your gut-immune 
interaction is fixed by age three. In a recent study, 
eating a high fiber diet that includes plenty of 
fermented foods (see pages 48–53), was shown  
to increase both the function and diversity of 
microbiota, leading to personalized immune 
responses and decreased inflammation.
Our microbiota is believed to stabilize by the age  
of three, remaining similar from that point into 
adulthood. This suggests that early life experiences 
may impact the composition of this bacteria, 
affecting us throughout our lives.

IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN SLEEP QUALITY  
AND NUTRITION? 
It has not been fully determined whether sleep quality affects the diet and vice versa, 
but there does seem to be a link. What is crystal clear, however, is how important 
good-quality sleep is to our health and sense of well-being.
Sleep deprivation can cause health problems. During 
sleep, the body and mind relax and recharge, giving 
us energy for the next day. Much maintenance and 
repair work takes place in the body when we sleep.
SLEEP HYGIENE
Diet and sleep hygiene (sleep quality) seem to  
be linked. Having enough good-quality sleep, 
combined with eating regularly during the day, 
determines the healthy production of hormones. 
Following a healthy, balanced diet (see pages 
40–41) is one of the best ways of achieving good 
sleep hygiene. Not surprisingly, a lot of evidence 
links the Mediterranean diet (see pages 36–39) with 
better sleep hygiene and lower levels of insomnia. 
POOR SLEEP HYGIENE AND WEIGHT GAIN
The relationship between insufficient sleep  
and obesity has been considerably researched. 
Insufficient sleep disrupts the hormones that  
govern appetite (see opposite), making us hungrier.
Research shows that people who sleep for less 
time often consume more calories and tend to opt 
for foods with a high fat content day to day than 
those who get sufficient sleep.
In lab experiments, sleep-deprived people tend to 
keep meal portions the same but snack late into the 
night (we’ve all been there!), eating on average closer 
to 130 percent of their daily calorie intake, with 
around 500 of these calories consumed late at night. 
At the risk of stating the obvious, from a nutritional 
standpoint, it makes sense to simply go to sleep when 
you are tired, rather than snacking to keep awake.
POOR SLEEP HYGIENE AND WEIGHT LOSS
In one study of dieters sleeping less than six hours 
per night, in the case of 70 percent of participants, 
all weight lost was from lean muscle mass, not fat. 
Fat is an energy-rich substance. When you don’t 
sleep enough, cortisol levels rise, pushing the body 
more easily into flight-or-fight mode. The body 
becomes reluctant to give up fat, preferring to reserve 
this rich energy source for impending fight or flight. 
So it turns to metabolizing muscle (which is protein). 
In other words, if you’re trying to lose weight but 
getting insufficient sleep, you will lose what you 
want to keep—muscle—and you will hold on to what 
you want to lose—fat. You may be dieting diligently, 
managing your cravings, then unraveling all your 
hard work simply because of lack of sleep.
SLEEP-FRIENDLY DIETARY HABITS
Avoid foods that hinder sleep. Spicy foods, caffeine 
(see page 72), and alcohol can all prevent sleep.
Try a small protein/carbohydrate snack before  
bed. Tryptophan, an amino acid that promotes sleep, 
is found in small quantities in all protein foods.  
The best sources are eggs, soybeans, poultry, meat, 
fish, and cheese. It is a precursor to the sleep-
inducing chemicals serotonin and melatonin.  
For tryptophan to have a sedative effect, it needs 
 to be consumed with a carbohydrate food.

================================================================================
Sleep deprivation 
causes disruption of many 
hormones, including those 
that govern sleep (see page 
105). More ghrelin (the 
hunger hormone) than 
normal is released when 
sleep deprived, while less 
leptin (the satiety hormone) 
is present, leading to 
snacking and overeating. 
This is reversed when  
you’ve had enough sleep.

CAN DIET HELP REDUCE 
MENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS? 
Half of the world’s population experiences menstruation during their lifetimes,  
yet there has not been much good-quality research exploring how diet  
influences menstruation and period pain.
What we know is that certain nutrients (see 
opposite) seem to reduce symptoms, so it makes 
sense to try to include them in your diet daily. 
PMS
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of 
physical and psychological complaints experienced 
during the days leading up to menstruation and 
once bleeding begins. Symptoms include low mood 
and mood swings, headache, bloating, lower 
backache, breast tenderness, acne, and fatigue. 
An estimated 30–40 percent of women experience 
PMS, with 77 percent experiencing psychological 
symptoms and 71 percent suffering from tiredness 
and, in some cases, debilitating exhaustion. One in 
three women report being unable to perform as usual.
Low calcium and vitamin D levels may exacerbate 
symptoms. Research shows that supplementing and/
or consuming foods rich in these nutrients may help 
relieve symptoms. Take a 10mcg supplement of 
vitamin D. Iron may help increase energy levels.  
As the body loses iron in menstrual blood, it makes 
sense to ensure dietary sources of iron are kept high 
during menstruation to avoid risk of a deficiency.
CRAMPS
Dysmenorrhea (cramps) is the most common period 
symptom, affecting 85 percent of women. When 
menstruation begins, there is a rise in inflammatory 
compounds called prostaglandins. These cause the 
uterine muscle to contract and release blood.
Magnesium and omega-3 may help relieve the 
cramping sensation by reducing contractions.  
Recent studies show that supplementation  
with omega-3 fatty acids, known for their anti-
inflammatory properties, may reduce pain intensity. 
Similar results are shown with fish oils. 
Supplementation with vitamins D and E and 
ginger may also reduce the severity of cramps. 
Ginger contains gingerol and gingerdione, which 
may have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.
There is some limited evidence indicating that  
a low-fat vegetarian diet and calcium supplements 
reduce the duration and intensity of period pains. 
DIGESTIVE COMPLAINTS
Many people report digestive discomfort and a 
change in bowel habits during their period, with the 
most disruption occurring on day one. In the days 
leading up to this day, levels of the hormones 
estrogen and progesterone rise in preparation for a 
possible pregnancy. These hormones are known to 
slow gastrointestinal motility. 
Focus on eating as well as possible, including lots  
of fiber in the diet and drinking plenty of water to 
keep bowel movements healthy. It also makes sense 
to reduce your consumption of foods that can 
increase inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract 
and cause bloating, such as alcohol, caffeine, fatty 
foods, and fizzy drinks. Some (uncontrolled) research 
suggests that habitual caffeine intake is associated 
with menstrual abnormalities.

SHOULD I EAT DIFFERENTLY  
FOR MENOPAUSE?
The symptoms of menopause still aren’t discussed openly enough, even though half of 
the population will experience them to varying degrees—all the more reason to talk 
about whether certain foods could help ease this major life transition.
For most women, menopause is a natural aging 
process during which they lose their period due to 
declining estrogen levels. Plant compounds called 
phytoestrogens may help ease hot flashes and night 
sweats, the most common symptoms. So far, research 
has focused on one type—isoflavones—found in 
soybeans and soy-based foods and drinks. Only 
10%–20% of Asian women experience hot flashes 
compared with a large majority of perimenopausal 
or menopausal women in the US, where soy intake  
is lower. 
Findings from research into soy’s impact on 
symptoms have been mixed. However, a 2021 review 
of more than 400 studies concluded that eating 
around 50mg (milligrams) of isoflavones daily is 
associated with both reduced frequency and severity 
of hot flashes. This amount can be obtained from 
two servings of soy foods or drinks within a 
balanced diet. Scientists don’t yet understand  
the precise mechanism, but isoflavones appear  
to produce a weak estrogen-like effect without 
actually affecting estrogen levels. 
Soy-based cheese and meat alternatives often 
have added salt and more fat than tofu, tempeh,  
and soybeans, so eat these less often. Caffeine  
and alcohol can also exacerbate hot flashes.
BREAST CANCER RISK 
Some breast cancers are estrogen-dependent,  
and studies have identified a link between soy  
and increased risk. The 2021 review concluded  
that isoflavones are chemically different to estrogen, 
and soy isoflavones are safe to eat as part of a 
healthy diet without increased risk of breast cancer 
occurring or recurring. This is based on eating up  
to 100mg of isoflavones daily—around 9oz of tofu 
Human estrogen is able to  
bind to a similar degree to both  
types of estrogen receptors 
found on organs and tissues  
around the body.
Soy isoflavones prefer to bind to one 
type of estrogen receptor and may 
affect the body differently to human 
estrogen, such as having  
an antioxidant effect.

SOY ISOFLAVONE
Soy isoflavones have  
a similar, though not 
identical, chemical 
structure to human

they can act in different 
ways to ostrogen. Some 
people may experience  
mild estrogen-like effects, 
like less severe hot flashes, 
and others no effects.

or up to 29oz of soy milk. (It may still be  
best to take medical advice before consuming

HEART AND BONE HEALTH
Postmenopausal women are at a higher risk of 
cardiovascular disease and should eat less salt and  
more fiber and replace saturated fats with 
unsaturated. Calcium is also important because 
menopause can accelerate the age-related decline  
in bone mineral density. You should get a sufficient 
amount in a healthy diet from sources, including 
leafy greens, calcium-fortified foods, dairy  
products, and fish eaten with bones. It’s also  
crucial to get enough vitamin D alongside  
calcium, and supplements may be required, 
especially if suffering from osteopenia and 
osteoporosis (see pages 138–139).

CAN I EAT TO SUPPORT  
THE AGING PROCESS?
As well as affecting appearance, flexibility, and cognitive health, getting older may 
increase our chances of developing a noncommunicable disease. Can diet help  
us live longer and improve well-being in later years? 
By 2050, there are expected to be two billion people 
over 60, more than double the number in 2015. 
Aging increases the risk of developing chronic 
conditions like type 2 diabetes, cancer, or heart 
disease, but scientists don’t yet fully understand  
the complex mechanisms behind it. One theory says 
antioxidants obtained from diet (like vitamins C  
and E, selenium, and zinc) may help protect us from 
potentially harmful free radical molecules and the 
damage to cells that speeds up as we age. Research 
indicates that it’s safer to obtain these nutrients 
from a balanced diet, including a wide range of 
plants, rather than from supplements; these often 
contain highly concentrated doses the body may not 
require, and too many could have damaging effects.
MEDITERRANEAN EATING 
Evidence generally points to a correlation between  
healthy lifestyle and lower risk of chronic disease. 
One study based on long-term data found that those 
who routinely ate a Mediterranean-style diet with 
plenty of vegetables, whole grains, and fish were 30

percent more likely to age successfully (defined  
as reaching 70 with no major mobility problems or

nearly half a million middle-aged adults found an 
overall healthy lifestyle, including diet, could 
increase male life expectancy by 6 years and  
female life expectancy by 7.5 years. 
SKIN AGING 
After age 20, collagen production gradually  
declines, and the number and size of skin cells 
reduces, making skin thinner. Fatty fish like  
salmon and mackerel may help support skin cells. 
Antioxidants in fruits and vegetables—especially 
vitamins A (beta carotene), E and C, lycopene,  
and lutein—may neutralize harm done by free 
radicals. Broaden your intake and include kale, 
carrots, spinach, red peppers, tomatoes, and

JOINT AND BRAIN SUPPORT
As we age, we lose muscle mass and bone density, 
increasing the risk of osteoporosis and frailty. 
Between ages 19–70, healthy adults should aim to 
consume 1,000mg of calcium for men and 1,200mg 
for women a day to protect bone health and enough 
vitamin D to absorb it (see pages 138–139). Older 
people (and breastfeeding women) should get at 
least 1,200mg. To help muscles repair and grow, aim 
to eat a portion (about palm size) of protein at each 
meal, such as chicken breast, beans and lentils, and 
tofu. Doing some weight-bearing exercise is 
important, too. Several studies have also found an 
association between lower overall mental decline  
and eating unsaturated fats (see pages 150–151). 

================================================================================

CAN I EAT TO GUARD  
AGAINST DEMENTIA?
"Dementia" describes different cognitive impairments that are often minor to start 
with, then become severe enough to affect daily life. Adopting healthy eating habits 
before reaching later years may be one way to reduce your risk. 
Dementia symptoms include difficulties with 
problem-solving or communication, loss of  
memory, and mood swings. There are many kinds  
of dementia, and specific symptoms depend on the 
underlying cause. In Alzheimer’s disease, the leading 
cause, structural changes in the brain cause cells to 
die, while restricted blood supply can cause vascular 
dementia. When it develops in older age, in some 
cases, dementia is thought to be lifestyle related.
 
DEMENTIA AND DIET 
Evidence indicates a healthy weight and lifestyle 
in midlife lessen the chances of developing 
dementia. A body of research also shows a positive 
association between cognition and diet; while this 
doesn’t establish causation, it points toward eating  
a varied, Mediterranean-style diet low in salt, sugar, 
and saturated fat and rich in vegetables and whole 
grains. Refined carbohydrates, including sugars 
added to many processed foods, are absorbed 
quickly and prompt a bigger insulin response than 
complex carbohydrates. People with type 2 diabetes 
appear to be at higher risk of dementia, but research 
into the reasons why is still at an early stage. It’s 
possible that excess insulin enables a protein called 
beta-amyloid to accumulate faster in the brain. 
 
BRAIN FOOD? 
Scientists designed the MIND (Mediterranean-
DASH Intervention for Neurogenerative Delay) diet 
to combine elements of two other diets that studies 
show are both beneficial for reducing the risk of 
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems. 
Notably, though, it emphasizes leafy greens 
(although eating other vegetables is important)  
and berries, because their antioxidant properties can 
help reduce oxidative stress, an imbalance between 
free radicals and protective antioxidants in the body 
that can lead to cell damage.  
Otherwise, some studies indicate eating more 
omega-3 fatty acids reduces the chance of 
developing dementia; good sources include oily fish 
(see pages 42–43). However, others found no effects, 
so longer-term research is needed. A high level of 
compounds called advanced glycation end products 
(AGEs) is associated with the inflammation and 
oxidative stress that precede many chronic diseases, 
including Alzheimer’s; these may also contribute to 
the tangling of Tau proteins inside brain cells. AGEs 
form inside the body when blood glucose combines 
with proteins or fats; high levels may also form in 
foods exposed to high-temperature cooking.

WHY DO I FEEL BLOATED?
Bloating is the sensation associated with gas in our gut, when your abdomen feels 
swollen and is commonly distended. It can make us feel uncomfortably full and is 
sometimes accompanied by pain, flatulence, and nausea.
Even in a “fasted” state, our gastrointestinal tract 
contains gases, which increase after eating due to 
swallowing air and gases produced during digestion. 
But it is normal for our stomachs to distend when 
we eat a meal—they are not supposed to remain flat!
Eating high-fiber foods, such as legumes, may 
lead to bloating due to increased gas production in 
the large intestine; but for many, fiber can reduce 
bloating by improving digestion and speeding up 
gut transit. When we swallow, air enters our stomach 
and can lead to abdominal distention. This is 
enhanced when we eat too quickly or drink a lot of 
liquid while eating, especially carbonated drinks. 
Other key contributing factors include:
Stress  Feeling stressed can affect communication 
mechanisms of the gut-brain axis (see pages 48–49),  
for example, by changing levels of neurotransmitters, 
which can disturb our ability to digest foods well 
and lead to constipation or diarrhea by affecting  
gut motility.
Hormones  Women report feeling bloated more than 
men, probably due to differences in sex hormones 
and fluctuations in their levels. Progesterone rise 
before a period can promote bloating and other 
digestive issues; whereas estrogen stimulates gut 
muscle relaxation by inducing nitric oxide synthase.
Gut microbiota  Our gut bacteria breaks down 
indigestible foods, producing gases as a by-product. 
More bloating is experienced in those with IBS  
(see page 164) due to visceral hypersensitivity. 
Studies have shown that the amount of gas 
produced is actually similar to healthy individuals.
Can you treat it?
THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL CURE, AND 
TREATMENT PLANS TEND TO BE PERSONALIZED.
They range from lifestyle changes relating to diet, 
exercise, and stress; to administering probiotics; to 
medications such as laxatives in those with 
constipation or antibiotics for SIBO sufferers. 
Identifying the potential cause is important for 
addressing underlying conditions, for example, 
dietary issues in patients with IBS or food 
intolerances. While bloating is common and fairly 
normal, do see your primary care physician if this is 
persistent to rule out any gastrointestinal disorders.
Constipation  Delay in passing stool and increase  
in stool bulk leads to the accumulation and trapping 
of gases, exacerbated by the longer time spent in the 
large bowel, which increases bacterial fermentation.
Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)  
Most gut bacteria live in our large intestine. SIBO 
occurs when these grow in the small intestine and 
disrupt digestion and absorption, leading to bloating.
Sensitive gut  Evidence has emerged for a condition 
called visceral hypersensitivity, which describes 
greater sensitivity or perception to bloating and 
other symptoms. Patients with gastrointestinal 
disorders are particularly prone to sensitive gut.
Intolerances  For those with food intolerances, 
eating such foods can lead to bloating. For example, 
the lactose intolerant do not have the enzyme to 
digest lactose in cows’ milk, so this is broken down 
by gut bacteria instead, producing excess gas.

IS IT NORMAL TO FART? 
Flatulence might feel embarrassing, but it is perfectly normal to pass wind  
and an important part of digestion. You will never hear a nutritionist shying  
away from discussing farts!
Most people fart 5 to 15 times a day. Farting is a 
sign of a healthy gut microbiome (see pages 48–49), 
but if it becomes foul smelling or increases in 
frequency, it may need investigating.
EXCESS GAS
We fart because of natural fermentation in the gut. 
There can be several reasons for producing abnormal 
quantities of gas: feeding the gut too much; when  
we can’t digest certain foods because of a food 
intolerance; if you suddenly increase the amount  
of fiber in the diet, this can shock the body as it  
isn’t used to working that hard; or if food travels too 
quickly through our intestines, for example, when 
we get diarrhea. Conversely, if food moves too slowly 
through our intestines and we become constipated, 
the fermentation process has a long time to “brew” 
food that would have normally been excreted, 
producing gas as a by-product.
UNPLEASANT ODORS
Mostly, the gas we produce when we pass wind has 
no odor. Foul-smelling farts happen when our gut 
breaks down sulfur-containing compounds, which 
contributes to sulfur-containing—and 
smelly—gases like hydrogen sulfide. If  
you experience these smells frequently,  
it may be worth looking at your diet 
and speaking to a registered  
dietitian nutritionist 
for some help. 
Foods that can contribute to sulfurous wind include:
  Animal proteins—meat, protein powders, eggs
  Plant foods—broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower,  
garlic, onions
  Drinks—wine, beer
While everyone is unique, many scientists report 
high protein intake as the main cause of smelly wind, 
and advise action to lower levels of protein in the 
diet first (see page 15 for recommended intakes), 
before cutting back on any plant foods. By safely and 
slowly increasing fiber in the diet from plant-based 
foods, you may actually help gut microbiota by 
enabling them to break down food at a  
consistent pace instead 
of waiting around in  
a stop-start manner.
Red cabbage Not only 
cabbage, but all vegetables 
in the Brassica family cause 
smelly farts.

WHY AM I 
CONSTIPATED?
Constipation can be frustrating and sometimes 
painful, resulting in a lot of straining and hard poop.
Food that can’t be digested by your body goes into your large 
intestine, where it mixes with fluid to form poop. Bowel muscles 
then tense and relax to push poop toward your bottom. If you 
often find it difficult to poop, you may be constipated:
  Slow transit constipation occurs when your stool takes  
such a long time to get through the large intestine, much of  
its water content is absorbed and it turns hard and dry.
  Evacuation disorder comes down to the final push to  
excrete the stool, when coordination of the muscles involved  
is poor. This could have been a result of childhood toilet habits  
or be a structural problem of your biology.
  Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome  
is a type of IBS mostly owed to constipation (see page 164).
CONSTIPATION IN CHILDREN
Our digestive system undergoes changes from birth to adulthood, 
but especially in the first year of life with the introduction of 
solids, and constipation is a common symptom of weaning. 
Children with abdominal pain often simply have constipation  
but should always be checked out.
HOW CAN I RELIEVE CONSTIPATION?
Drink a minimum of 6–8 cups water per day and gradually  
increase fiber in your diet from plant foods. Fiber provides bulk  
to poop since it isn’t absorbed through the gut lining; fiber also 
absorbs water, softening poop. Exercise can also help with gut 
motility. Laxatives are helpful in some situations, for example, 
post-childbirth and in those with a lot of pain, but they can also 
make constipation worse and you may become dependent on them, 
which can influence gut microbiota and toilet habits. Sitting on the 
toilet with your back straight at 90 degrees to your legs can cause 
the intestine to be pinched. Adopt a more ‘‘crouching’’ position with 
your legs at 35 degrees to your torso; a foot rest can be helpful.

IS DIARRHEA CAUSED BY DIET?
Diarrhea is a condition where you pass loose, watery stools more frequently  
than is normal and can be triggered by a whole host of things from stress  
to travel, anxiety, and the food we eat. 
Each day, nine liters of water enter our small intestine, 
90 percent of which is reabsorbed. Diarrhea occurs 
when there is too much water in the intestine or not 
enough of it is reabsorbed. While diarrhea causes  
dehydration, simply drinking more water can make 
severe diarrhea worse and may require an oral 
rehydration solution instead. 
ELECTROLYTE LOSS
A bout of diarrhea can leave you with an imbalance 
of electrolytes—minerals, including sodium, 
potassium, and calcium, that help regulate fluids in 
the body and facilitate proper functioning of cells. 
Replenish electrolytes with rehydration powders or 
by drinking milk or coconut water. Short-term 
diarrhea can be managed at home for most people, 
but chronic diarrhea can be a cause for concern, so 
visit your primary care physician as soon as possible.
CONTAMINATED FOOD AND WATER
Diet may cause diarrhea when bacteria, such as 
Campylobacter or Escherichia coli (E. coli), enter the 
body through contaminated food; or a parasite, such 
as that which causes giardiasis (contributing  
to gastritis), enters in contaminated water. These  
are common causes of diarrhea when vacationing  
in places with poor hygiene standards: practice  
good hygiene (see right) and avoid potentially  
unsafe tap water and undercooked food.
FOOD TRIGGERS
If you have a food intolerance, this can lead to loose 
stools; and diet may also trigger IBS symptoms, 
which can include diarrhea (see pages 158–167).  
Other more general food-related causes include:
  Spicy food can irritate the stomach lining.
  Fatty fried foods contain saturated fats and trans 
fats, which the body can sometimes struggle to break 
down, leading to diarrhea or worsening symptoms.
  Coffee stimulates your digestive system, as well  
as making you mentally alert, and many people have 
a bowel movement soon after a cup of coffee.
  Drinking alcohol can lead to loose stools the 
next day, especially when drinking beer or wine.
  High FODMAP foods containing Fermentable, 
Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides 
and Polyols can cause diarrhea. For example, garlic 
and onions contain fructans, which is a carbohydrate 
some people with IBS find difficult to digest. (They 
also contain insoluble fiber, which can make foods 
move through the digestive system faster.)
  Some artificial sweeteners can upset the 
digestive system, so much so that foods containing 
them may have labels warning of their laxative effect.
Good hygiene
REDUCE YOUR RISK OF DEVELOPING  
DIARRHEA FROM CONTAMINANTS BY  
MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS OF HYGIENE:
 
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap  
and warm water after going to the bathroom and  
before eating or preparing food.
Clean the toilet, including the handle and the  
seat, with disinfectant after each bout of diarrhea.
Avoid sharing towels, sheets, or utensils  
with other household members.

SHOULD I BE WORRIED  
ABOUT FOOD ALLERGIES  
AND INTOLERANCES?
Abnormal responses to eating food, or ‘‘adverse food reactions,’’ can be the result of 
either a food intolerance (often called sensitivity) or a food allergy. Despite often 
being lumped together, these are two very different reactions.
All of us experience digestive discomfort from time 
to time; if mild and infrequent, there is usually no 
cause for concern. However, regular discomfort after 
eating may indicate an allergy or intolerance. Allergies 
can be severe and in some cases life threatening, so 
it’s important to know the signs. About 2 percent of 
adults and 4–8 percent of kids in the US have a food 
allergy; intolerances seem more prevalent.
FOOD ALLERGIES
A food allergy is an adverse immune response. It 
usually comes on suddenly and can be triggered by  
a small amount of food. The allergic reaction will 
occur every time you consume the food, regardless  
of how much you eat or how frequently you eat it. 
There are two different types of allergic responses. 
IgE-mediated allergies are when the body creates 
antibodies specific to the food that has been 
digested. These allergies can be lifelong, with 
symptoms ranging from hives and swelling to 
anaphylactic shock. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies 
involve other components of the immune system. 
These reactions come on more slowly and are harder 
to diagnose, with symptoms including bloating, 
vomiting, and diarrhea.
Several factors can cause food allergies, including 
diet, environment, and genetics. The dual-allergen 
exposure hypothesis suggests that early exposure to 
IgE-mediated allergic reaction
When IgE first binds an allergen to a dendritic 
cell, it starts a process to produce more allergen-
specific IgEs. The IgEs then stick to mast cells (an 
immune cell) in the digestive tract, ready to react 
to the same protein when it is consumed again.

food allergens via the skin (for instance, nut oils 
in moisturizers) could increase the likelihood of 
allergy, while consumption of those allergens in 
infancy could encourage tolerance. Researchers 
have linked early and regular consumption of 
peanuts to prevention of peanut allergy, 
particularly in children at higher risk because of 
a compromised skin barrier, such as those with 
eczema. (Whole nuts and peanuts should not be 
given to children under five due to choking risk.)
INTOLERANCES
An intolerance is a nonimmune response that 
directly impacts digestion. Intolerances often 
relate to the amount of food consumed or the 
frequency of consumption. Some are triggered 
by certain chemicals in food, while others 
develop if you lack the enzymes needed to break 
down a specific food. While not life threatening, 
food intolerances can greatly impact quality of 
life. Symptoms tend to come on gradually and 
can include rashes, itching, bloating, and 
diarrhea (the last two can also be caused by 
other diseases, such as bowel cancer, so get  
them checked out by your doctor).
THE DIET-INDUSTRY TRAP
It may seem like everyone has an intolerance 
these days, with seemingly more and more 
people changing their diets for fear of food 
intolerance. But there is no evidence to account 
for the rise; the apparent increase is more likely 
due to self-reporting and fad diets than actual 
incidences. One study found that 34 percent of 
parents reported food allergies in their children 
but only 5 percent were found to have an allergy.
The media is rife with misinformation that 
encourages people to waste money on expensive 
products they don’t need. Unregulated 
alternative health therapists are diagnosing 
people with intolerances they don’t have, 
potentially delaying a correct diagnosis from a 
qualified health professional (see pages 160–161). 
Excluding common staples, such as bread, from 
our diets can even lead to malnutrition. What’s 
more, a developing concern is that by restricting 
foods unnecessarily, people may become more  
at risk of developing an eating disorder. See a 
credentialed health professional for a proper 
diagnosis or advice, and make changes to your 
diet according to their guidelines.

HOW CAN I FIND OUT IF I HAVE 
AN ALLERGY OR INTOLERANCE?
Food allergies and intolerances can make life very difficult, so if you  
think you have one, it’s important to ask for medical support in identifying,  
treating, and managing the issue.
Figuring out whether you suffer from an allergy  
or intolerance can be a difficult process. There are 
many unanswered questions in the scientific world 
about allergies. If you are worried, it’s best to seek 
help from a doctor before eliminating a food group 
completely, to enable you to get tested correctly and 
avoid any nutritional deficiencies. It’s a good idea  
to keep a food diary and monitor your symptoms.
DIAGNOSING FOOD ALLERGIES
There are many foods that people can be allergic to, 
some of the most common being milk, wheat, eggs, 
peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, and some fruits 
and vegetables. In addition, some food additives  
can increase the symptoms of an existing allergy.  
For instance, sulfites, used to preserve food, can 
cause some people with asthma to have an attack, 
though it is not necessary for all asthma sufferers  
to avoid them. Oral allergy syndrome is a less 
common type of allergy, in which the body mistakes 
the protein in some fruits or vegetables for pollen, 
causing symptoms such as an itchy mouth and/or 
throat, and mild swelling in the mouth area.
Celiac disease (where the small intestine is 
hypersensitive to gluten) is technically not a food 
allergy,but an autoimmune disease caused by an 
allergic reaction to gluten, a group of proteins found 
in wheat, barley, and rye. It is thought to affect at 
least 1% of Americans; however, only about 30 
percent of people with the condition are currently 
Lactose is a type of sugar found in most 
dairy products. In humans, the enzyme 
lactase is needed to break down lactose, 
so when the body doesn’t produce enough 
lactase, the lactose passes through the 
gut undigested, leading to symptoms of 
intolerance, such as cramps and bloating.

clinically diagnosed. Symptoms may include 
cramps, bloating, nausea, and reflux. It is 
possible to have a wheat allergy and not have 
celiac disease, or to have nonceliac gluten-
sensitivity (though little is known about this).
Not much is known about why people develop 
allergies. If someone in your family has or had 
an allergy, you will be more likely to develop 
one, too, though not necessarily the same one. 
Those with allergies often have other conditions, 
such as asthma and hay fever.
An IgE-mediated food allergy (see pages 
158–159) can be diagnosed either by measuring 
the antibodies present in the blood or by 
inserting allergens into the skin and looking for 
a reaction. Alternatively, a supervised elimination 
diet can help you figure out what the allergen is.
SPOTTING FOOD INTOLERANCES
The list of foods that can cause digestive 
discomfort is long. Common triggers include 
food additives such as MSG, caffeine, alcohol, 
artificial sweeteners and preservatives, a group 
of carbohydrates known as FODMAPs (see 
pages 166–167), eggs, yeast, fructose, and even 
toxins that enter food. Few food intolerances  
are lifelong, and in most cases, people can eat 
small amounts without enduring problems.
Two of the most widely discussed food 
intolerances are to wheat and lactose. Gluten  
is often mistakenly blamed for digestive 
discomfort, but gluten intolerances are not 
medically recognized, and a lot of the time the 
symptoms may be due to something else, such 
as IBS, stress, anxiety, IBD, or celiac disease. 
Lactose is a disaccharide sugar mainly found  
in dairy products. An intolerance occurs when  
a person lacks the enzyme lactase (see below) 
so cannot break down the disaccharide into 
monosaccharides glucose and galactose to then 
enter the blood. This can lead to a buildup of 
lactose in the digestive system, resulting in 
wind, cramps, diarrhea, bloating, and nausea. 
(See pages 162–163 for more on cutting gluten 
and lactose from your diet.)
There is currently no clinically valid test for 
diagnosing an intolerance. Instead, they are 
confirmed by cutting out suspected trigger 
foods and observing symptoms, followed by 
gradual reintroduction of the excluded foods.

HOW DO I CUT GLUTEN OR 
LACTOSE FROM MY DIET?
If you’ve been told by your doctor to eliminate either gluten or lactose from 
your diet, it may seem like a daunting prospect, but you can do so successfully 
without compromising on nutrition.
The majority of people won’t need to cut gluten or 
lactose from their diets, but those who are advised  
to often see dramatic benefits to their health and 
energy levels, provided they maintain a healthy, 
balanced diet with alternative foods. Consult a 
doctor or registered dietitian to figure out what 
exactly you need to exclude, and remember that 
while going gluten-free can have positive outcomes 
for some, for others it may do more harm than good.
ELIMINATING WHEAT OR GLUTEN
Be aware of the difference between wheat and gluten 
if you need to avoid one or both. If diagnosed with 
celiac disease (when the immune system reacts 
abnormally to gluten), you may need to exclude  
rye, barley, and oats from your diet as well as gluten. 
Some individuals with a wheat allergy (which occurs 
when the body produces antibodies to proteins 
found in wheat) will be able to have a variety of 
grains, and others will not; for most, it is safest to 
eliminate gluten entirely. Gluten-free products are 
not always wheat-free and vice versa, so check labels.
Gluten is found in many everyday products  
(see left). It also crops up in convenience foods,  
so be sure to check labels carefully. Thankfully, it’s 
possible to buy wheat-free or gluten-free versions of 
these food items. In addition to flour, baking powder 
can also be wheat- or gluten-free. And watch out for 
xanthan gum, which is often added to baking items 
to help with the texture and binding of the mixture; 
those who have celiac disease or gluten intolerance 
often react to this, too.
What is gluten?  The proteins gliadin and 
glutenin combine with water to create a mesh 
structure known as gluten, which has an elastic 
quality that is especially useful in baking.

Lactose digestion  Lactose is  
a natural sugar found in milk. 
It is broken down in the small 
intestine by the enzyme lactase 
into two simple sugars, glucose 
and galactose, which are then 
absorbed into the blood.
Gluten-free products are lower in fiber  
and often higher in fat and sugar than  
their gluten-containing equivalents, and 
since they are not governed by the same 
fortification rules as wheat products, they  
may also contain fewer vitamins and minerals, 
including iron, B vitamins, and calcium.  
Gluten-free products are also lower in protein 
given that the gluten (protein) is removed.
ELIMINATING LACTOSE
Like the gluten/wheat distinction, there is a 
difference between lactose intolerance and  
a milk allergy. The former results from a lack  
of lactase, the enzyme that breaks down 
lactose into more easily absorbed sugars  
(see above and pages 160–161). The latter is an 
immune reaction to one of the many proteins 
in animal milk, though it’s most often caused 
by the alpha S1-casein protein in cow’s milk. 
Bear in mind that while lactose-free products 
don’t contain the sugar lactose, they may still 
contain milk proteins.
When eliminating lactose-containing foods, 
think about the vitamins and minerals you 
would be getting in the original product and 
aim to replace them elsewhere in your diet. 
Look for foods that contain calcium, vitamins 
D and B12, and iodine, in particular. For 
instance, B12 and iodine are found in fish  
and eggs. Lactose-free products contain the 
same vitamins and minerals as standard dairy 
products, but they also have lactase added, 
which helps the body digest any lactose taken 
in. Rice, oat, almond, cashew, quinoa, soy, and 
pea milk are all great dairy-free milk 
alternatives (though rice milk should not be 
given to under-fives due to its arsenic content).
Cow’s milk is often added to manufactured 
foods, so it isn’t just a simple case of 
eliminating obvious dairy products, such as 
milk, butter, cheese, and yogurt. For common 
ingredients derived from cow’s milk, see right.
BEING MINDFUL
You will need to be vigilant about everything 
you eat, to avoid cross-contamination. In the 
US, it’s law that allergens must be clearly 
mentioned on food packaging, usually 
emphasized in bold and listed in one place. 
“May contain” statements are often used on 
packaging to state that a food may be 
contaminated with one or more common 
allergens. Restaurants and cafés must also 
provide all dietary information on allergens  
in writing and communicate them verbally.

COULD I HAVE IRRITABLE  
BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS)?
If you suffer from digestive discomfort and don’t believe it to be caused by a food 
intolerance, it’s possible you could have IBS—though see a doctor to be sure.
Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common type 
of functional gastrointestinal disease, with global 
prevalence ranging from 2–15 percent. IBS is more 
common in women, and, unlike many illnesses, 
incidence decreases with age. Symptoms vary  
and can change over time, but commonly include 
bloating, constipation, and/or diarrhea, and 
recurrent abdominal pain—to be diagnosed with 
IBS, you must have experienced frequent abdominal 
pain for at least three months, with symptom onset 
at least six months prior to diagnosis.
DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT
The mechanisms behind IBS are still unclear, but 
research suggests that they are multifactorial and 
patient dependent. IBS is now considered a disorder 
of the gut-brain axis (see page 49); in many cases, it 
can be caused by stress. Certain molecules in food 
may play a large part, too (see page 166). Since IBS 
mimics other disorders, it is often hard to diagnose. 
Doctors tend to start by assessing a patient’s clinical 
history to identify and rule out other diseases, then 
perform a physical examination, sometimes requiring 
laboratory tests and colonoscopies. There are four 
IBS subtypes: IBS-C (constipation predominant), 
IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), IBS-M (mixed 
bowel habits), and IBS-U (unclassified).
Not everyone responds to IBS treatments in the 
same way. Often, changes to diet and lifestyle are 
recommended first; then you may try antibiotics, 
antispasmodics, antidepressants (as neuromodulators 
that can impact gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, 
and gastrointestinal transit speed), laxatives, or 
antidiarrheal drugs, as well as cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) and other psychological 
interventions. However, the treatments are by no 
means a cure and tend to target only one part of 
what is a multi-modal condition. Reducing or 
eliminating intake of certain foods can be effective 
(see pages 166–167).

A common symptom  
of IBS, intestinal  
spasms occur when  
the muscles of the gut

WHAT IS IBD?
Often confused with IBS, irritable bowel disease (IBD) refers to two conditions causing 
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.
Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, from the mouth to the 
anus, though in most patients, the lower part of the 
small intestine is affected. Inflammation is patchy 
and can extend through multiple layers of the GI 
tract walls. In ulcerative colitis, the inflammation is 
confined to the colon (or large intestine) and rectum. 
This condition causes ulcers to develop on the inner 
lining of the bowel, which may bleed and produce 
mucus. Symptoms of both types of IBD include 
persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, 
weight loss, and fatigue.
As with IBS, the causes of IBD are not yet fully 
understood. Researchers believe that diet, stress, 
immunity, and genetics are all factors, with risk 
levels dependent on age, ethnicity, family history, 
cigarette smoking, and high usage of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
IBD is diagnosed first through testing levels  
of fecal calprotectin, then with an endoscopy or 
colonoscopy and biopsies. There are a number of 
medications that can be used in treatment, but  
Celiac disease
WHILE NOT A FORM OF IBD ITSELF, CELIAC 
DISEASE CAN CAUSE SIMILAR SYMPTOMS. 
The condition causes your immune system to 
attack your own tissues when you eat gluten, 
damaging the small intestine’s lining, which can 
decrease absorption of nutrients. If untreated, 
complications can include anemia, osteoporosis, 
infertility, neurological conditions and nerve 
damage, and, rarely, small bowel cancer and 
intestinal lymphoma. (See also page 160.)
diet can also play a huge role, especially in those  
with mild IBD. Doctors also recommend that  
IBD patients are given a number of vaccinations  
to prevent infections. In severe cases, a patient may 
undergo surgery to remove damaged portions of  
the GI tract, though this has become less common 
thanks to advances in treatment with medications.

WHAT ARE FODMAPs AND CAN 
AVOIDING THEM CURE IBS?
If you have made changes to your lifestyle to improve symptoms of Irritable Bowel 
Syndrome (IBS; see page 164) but had no results, the next approach may well be to 
work with a registered dietitian nutritionist on what is known as the low-FODMAP diet.
FODMAPs—fermentable, oligosaccharides, 
disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols—are  
a group of carbohydrates that the small intestine 
cannot digest. When we eat them, they pass through 
to the large intestine where they are fermented by 
gut bacteria. Many foods fall into the FODMAP 
category, including apples, avocados, pears, mangoes, 
cauliflower, soybeans, rye, beans, and pulses.
“Fermentable” covers foods that can be 
fermented and used as food for gut 
bacteria. Oligosaccharides are a type of 
carbohydrate that usually contains 3–10 
simple sugar molecules, such as fructans, 
found in onions, garlic, wheat, rye, and 
barley, and galacto-oligosaccharides 
(GOS), found in beans and lentils. 
Disaccharides, such as lactose, contain two simple 
sugar molecules, and monosaccharides, such as 
fructose, contain one sugar molecule. Polyols, also 
known as “sugar alcohols,” are sorbitol and mannitol, 
which are mainly found in sugar-free sweets, mints, 
and chewing gum, plus certain fruits and vegetables.
HOW FODMAPS CAUSE SYMPTOMS
The mechanisms behind FODMAP 
symptom production are not fully known, 
but there are two main hypotheses:
  The “small bowel hypothesis” states 
that FODMAPs are osmotically active 
molecules (i.e., triggering the diffusion of 
water from an area of high concentration 
FODMAPs in the gut
FODMAPs may trigger 
excess water to either 
form in the small 
intestine or ferment  
in the large intestine, 
causing gut discomfort.
FOODS HIGH

Garlic, onions, broccoli, cauliflower, 
mushrooms, apples, pears, 
watermelon, cherries, and wheat 
products such as pasta and pastries 
are all classed as FODMAP foods

to an area of low concentration through a 
selectively permeable membrane), which cause 
an increase in water in the small intestine, 
leading to distension, bloating, and discomfort.
  The “large bowel hypothesis” suggests  
that FODMAPs increase colonic bacterial 
fermentation as well as gas production. This 
results in bloating, flatulence, and discomfort. It 
is also thought that psychological factors and an 
altered brain–gut axis (see p.49) caused by stress, 
anxiety, and a hectic lifestyle may play a role.
THE LOW-FODMAP DIET
The low-FODMAP diet (LFD) is a popular  
and effective way to ease IBS symptoms and 
improve patient quality of life. In fact, it has 
been proven to reduce gut symptoms in patients 
with IBS 70–80 percent of the time. While it  
can seem highly restrictive, if followed correctly, 
this diet allows for individual personalization.  
It is incredibly important to embark upon the 
LFD only with supervision, to ensure you 
remain healthy throughout. Patients have two  
or three appointments with a dietary specialist, 
and there are three stages in the process:

1.  Elimination: A period of four to six weeks 
when patients must restrict all FODMAPs from 
their diet. At the end of this period, they should 
see symptom improvement.
2.  Reintroduction: Over the following weeks, 
patients begin to reintroduce FODMAPs into 
their diet systematically, adding one food at a 
time back into the diet in increasing quantities, 
allowing the patient to identify their symptom 
threshold for each of the FODMAPs.
3.  Personalization: Over time, patients can 
personalize their diet, adding in the FODMAPs 
that don’t cause symptoms and reducing or 
eliminating those that do, to control symptoms 
while maintaining a nutritionally adequate diet.
If you think you have IBS, speak to your GP. 
While the LFD has excellent results in some 
people, only follow it if advised to do so and with 
professional support. It’s also not recommended 
to stay on the diet for a long period of time, as 
reduced gut microbiome diversity, which can be 
a result of the LFD, can be more detrimental to 
gut health in the long term.

WHAT IS AN  
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DIET?
There isn’t such a thing as an anti-inflammatory diet, but there may be a link 
between diet and inflammation. This area needs more research, but there’s no harm 
in trying a few recommendations to see how they work for you.
Inflammation is a natural process, the body’s  
normal response to some types of injury or illness 
(cuts or colds, for instance). It is part of your  
body’s defense system and the process of healing.
In some cases, people have chronic inflammation 
in the body. Arthritis, asthma, eczema, some heart 
and lung diseases, diabetes, and some cancers all 
involve chronic inflammation. The gut is susceptible 
to inflammation in some. Chronic inflammatory 
conditions of the gut include IBS and IBDs such  
as celiac disease (see pages 164–165). 
DIETARY CAUSES OF INFLAMMATION
Many studies have looked into the potential link 
between the food we consume and inflammation. 
These show that consuming the following foods  
and beverages in excess may cause inflammation:
  refined carbohydrates, such as white bread,  
cakes, and pastries
  French fries and other fried foods
  soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages
  red meat (like burgers or steaks) and processed 
meats (like hot dogs or sausage)
  margarine, shortening, and lard
Try limiting these items in your diet if you 
experience inflammation regularly.
REDUCING INFLAMMATION
Inflammation is a response of the immune system, 
and gut health has been linked to good immunity 
(see pages 140–141). This may be how we are able  
to have some influence on our immune health. Aim  
for a good diet that supports your gut microbiota.
Omega-3 fatty acids
PEOPLE WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS ARE 
ADVISED TO INCLUDE OMEGA-3 IN THE DIET.
Fish oils have been shown to help dampen general 
inflammation and may help reduce joint pain and 
stiffness. Try to eat two 5oz (140g) portions of oily 
fish per week. Some eggs and breads are enriched 
with omega-3. Omega-3 fats from plant sources 
(such as flaxseed, evening primrose, and borage oil) 
have a weaker effect on reducing inflammation and 
are of limited benefit. High-dose fish oil 
supplements (500–1000mg of EPA and DHA per 
capsule) have been shown to reduce symptoms  
of RA. Be patient—it can take up to three months  
for symptom relief. Speak to your doctor before 
taking any new supplements.
Certainly, a healthy diet is unlikely to aggravate 
inflammation, but there is no conclusive evidence 
linking specific foods to reducing inflammation, 
except in the case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
In one study, one group of people with RA was 
given a diet rich in fiber, oily fish, and probiotics, 
while another was provided one of protein, red  
meat, and saturated fat. Members of the first group 
experienced a health improvement. We need more 
research to explore these findings, but following 
dietary recommendations for people with RA 
(increase omega-3s, calcium, and iron) may reduce 
inflammation in other parts of the body. Some 
research shows a reduction of RA symptoms if 
following a Mediterranean diet (see pages 36–39).

WHAT IS DIABETES AND  
WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS?
Diabetes is a condition in which you have elevated levels of glucose in your blood. 
Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, has sudden onset and is not caused by diet. 
The onset of type 2 is gradual and less severe and is heavily influenced by diet.
When glucose is obtained from diet, it is released 
into the bloodstream for the body to use as fuel  
(see pages 12–13). The hormone insulin, supplied by 
the pancreas, helps cells access this fuel. People with 
diabetes have a problem with insulin, which means 
their cells cannot access glucose for fuel. Glucose 
remains in the bloodstream, causing hyperglycemia 
(high blood glucose levels). Sustained hyperglycemia 
can damage the eyes, kidneys, and heart.
In people with type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is 
unable to make insulin. The absence of insulin 
makes it impossible for the body to access glucose 
for energy, forcing it to break down fat instead.  
This releases fatty acids called ketones into the  
body. These can make the blood acidic, resulting  
in a life-threatening complication known as  
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 
In people with type 2, the pancreas fails to supply 
enough insulin. To gain more energy, the body 
signals to the pancreas to release more insulin.  
The pancreas then works very hard to pump out 
insulin, resulting in such high levels of insulin in the 
blood that cells become less sensitive to it (insulin 
resistance). The pancreas also becomes damaged.
Insulin enables  
cells to access glucose 
Insulin "unlocks" the cells, 
enabling glucose to enter so 
the cell can use it as a source 
of energy. When a person has 
diabetes, this system can 
break down at various stages.

 Hyperglycemia symptoms
IF YOU EXPERIENCE THESE SYMPTOMS, ASK  
YOUR DOCTOR FOR A BLOOD SUGAR CHECK:
  extreme thirst (polydipsia)
  frequent urination (polyuria)
  physical exhaustion
  weight loss and loss of muscle mass
  genital thrush (frequent, minor infections)
  slow healing of cuts and wounds 
  blurred vision.
RISK FACTORS
Approximately 8 percent of people with diabetes 
have type 1 and 90 percent have type 2. There  
may be a genetic risk involved in developing type 1 
diabetes. With type 2, there is a strong genetic risk 
factor—the child of a parent with type 2 has roughly  
a one-in-three chance of developing it. The more 
distant the genetic relationship, the slimmer the 
chance of developing the condition.
Ethnicity is also a factor: South Asian, Chinese, 
Black African, and African Caribbean people have  
a higher chance of developing type 2 than people of 
other ethnicities. 
Age is important. People over 40 (or younger  
in ethnic groups more at risk) are at higher risk. 
Being overweight or obese also increases the risk  
of developing type 2 diabetes, especially if you  
carry excess body fat around the abdomen. 
DIET AND DIABETES
Type 1 is a lifelong condition  
for which insulin injections and 
consistent medical monitoring  
are necessary. No dietary 
interventions can prevent or  
reverse it, although diet plays a  
role in managing the condition. 
When it comes to type 2 diabetes, the number  
of people being diagnosed is growing at a shocking 
rate. This is a health crisis in the making and, to a  
large degree, it is preventable. It’s important that 
people with a risk factor are aware that there  
is much they can do to avoid developing 
the condition (see pages 172–173).  
The same advice can help those  
who have already been diagnosed 
with type 2 diabetes to improve 
their symptoms and even reverse 
the condition.

172
CAN DIET HELP PREVENT OR 
MANAGE TYPE 2 DIABETES?
Yes! A healthy diet in conjunction with regular exercise and weight management 
drastically reduces the chances of developing type 2 diabetes and can help  
manage—and even reverse—the condition if it has already developed.
You are at a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes 
(prediabetes) if your blood sugar levels are 
consistently high and you experience symptoms  
of hyperglycemia (see page 170). While not everyone 
with prediabetes goes on to develop diabetes, a high 
percentage do. 
Certain dietary choices can help prevent type 2 
diabetes if you are prediabetic, but diet alone will 
not do it. You need a healthy lifestyle overall. People 
with a genetic risk factor (see page 171) with more 
sedentary lives are more likely to develop type 2 
diabetes than those who exercise regularly.
The same dietary choices can help “reverse” type 
2 diabetes. This term is used to describe a significant 
long-term improvement in insulin sensitivity (see 
page 170) in people with type 2 diabetes. Those who 
can get their HbA1c below 42 mmol/mol (6 percent) 
without taking diabetes medication are said to have 
reversed or resolved their diabetes or brought it  
into remission. (This is not the same as completely 
eliminating it, as unwise dietary and lifestyle choices 
could reestablish the condition, and permanent 
damage to the pancreas may also have been done.)
DIETARY MEASURES
There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to getting your 
diet right, but the previous advice to avoid sugar 
altogether and cut carbs is no longer recommended. 
People with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes should 
enjoy all the food groups and a balanced healthy 
diet, like the Mediterranean diet (see pages 36–39). 
Include plenty of fiber (see pages 18–19) and opt for 
whole grains to help keep blood glucose levels steady. 
Even small changes can make a difference, such as 
consuming whole fruit rather than fruit juice.
Portion control, to avoid overeating, is important 
for preventing and controlling type 2 diabetes. 
Mindful eating (see pages 206–207) can help make 
you stop eating on autopilot and become more aware 
of your eating patterns. Take a moment to assess how 
you feel before you reach for a food item. Are you 
doing so out of habit, or boredom, or are you actually 
To diagnose diabetes, levels of gylcated 
hemoglobin (Hb1Ac) are tested over a period  
of 2–3 months. When the body is unable to  
use glucose properly (see pages 170–171), unused 
glucose in the bloodstream sticks to red blood  
cells (hemoglobin)—they become glycated. High 
Hb1Ac levels indicates prediabetes or diabetes. As 
blood cells are renewed every 2–3 months, testing 
across this period reveals an average reading.

these can help you identify unhelpful habits. 
LOW-CARB DIET
One of the few cases in which a low-carb diet  
is recommended is in the case of type 2 diabetes. 
Research indicates that following a low-carb  
diet is an effective way to reverse the condition. 
A trial showed that consuming 50–130g carbs 
per day helped manage weight and improve 
blood sugar levels and cardiovascular risk in 
people with type 2 diabetes who were tested  
for up to 12 months.
If you have type 2 diabetes and are considering 
a low-carb diet, get the support of a dietitian to 
ensure your diet is nutritionally adequate. When 
a macronutrient is removed from the diet in  
this way, the knock-on effects can be dangerous  
(see pages 110–111). For instance, carbs contain 
fiber, which helps control blood sugar levels and 
keeps the gut microbiome happy (see pages 
48–53). Suddenly reducing carbs can result in 
constipation (see page 155). More research is 
needed to identify the best dietary patterns on  
a low-carb diet to maintain normal blood sugar 
levels and keep fiber intake up.
If you are on certain meds (including insulin 
or gliclazide), there is a possible risk with a 
low-carb diet of hypoglycemia or, in rare cases, 
ketoacidosis (see page 170). Speak to your doctor  
to help you manage risks and adjust medication 
as necessary. 

================================================================================

DO SOME FOODS CAUSE  
OR PREVENT CANCER?
Despite what you might have read on the internet, no one food or dietary pattern 
directly causes—or cures—cancer, so there’s no need to be overly restrictive with 
your diet. Food is not medicine, but it is essential to overall health and happiness.
Good nutrition during and beyond cancer treatment 
can help maintain a healthy weight, retain muscle 
mass and strength, and decrease overall side effects. 
If you have cancer, please speak to your doctor or 
dietitian before changing diet; the internet is full  
of dangerous advice, and it is best to seek support 
from credentialed health professionals to be safe.
CANCER FOOD MYTHS
Here are some of the top food myths around  
cancer that you should be extremely wary of:
  Acidic foods  You may have read that eliminating 
acidic foods and eating only alkaline foods can cure 
cancer. The “alkaline diet” is based on a notion that 
the food we eat has the potential to change how acid 
or alkaline our blood is, but this is scientifically not 
true (see opposite). Our bodies are tightly regulated, 
Could supplements help?
IN MOST CASES, SUPPLEMENTS ARE NOT  
AS EFFECTIVE AS A BALANCED DIET.  
Vitamin D supplements can help to support the 
immune system, especially if access to sunshine is 
limited. You should continue to take supplements 
needed for dietary requirements, such as vitamin  
B12 for vegans, which helps keep blood cells healthy. 
If appetite is low or you’re experiencing diarrhea  
and/or vomiting, and it’s difficult to eat, nutrient 
supplementation can be arranged often via liquids. 
Always check with your oncologist because some 
supplements may interfere with cancer treatments.
and lungs and kidneys maintain blood pH behind 
the scenes. There is no link at all between eating 
acidic foods and cancer.
  Juicing  Associated with the alkaline diet myth is 
a belief that consuming juices derived from alkaline 
ingredients can purge the body of acid and so cure 
cancer. Not only is this treatment highly unethical,  
it is incredibly dangerous and can be life threatening  
(see also detoxing, pages 112–113). By only juicing, 
you are depriving your body of essential nutrients 
vital for recovery, repair, and overall health, such as 
protein, fiber, calcium, and healthy fats.
  Soy  Fear of eating soy, especially with hormone-
positive breast cancers, stems from the idea that 
phytoestrogen compounds in soybeans have 
estrogen-like properties. However, plant-based 
estrogens are chemically different from human.  
In fact, research on consumption of soy foods and 
cancer (though limited), suggests that eating whole 
soybean products like tofu, tempeh, edamame, soy 
milk, or similar may actually have a positive impact 
on overall mortality and prevention of breast cancer.
  Fasting  Some animal studies have found fasting 
may have the potential to enhance chemotherapy. 
There have been a few human studies, but not 
enough to warrant suggesting fasting as an aid to 
cancer treatment. Fasting can carry many risks, 
especially if you’re diabetic, have a history of an 
eating disorder, a low BMI, or you have lost more 
than 10 percent of weight in the preceding year.

Busting the ‘‘alkaline diet’’ myth
The ‘‘alkaline diet’’ is based on a mistaken belief 
that the acidity or alkalinity of blood can greatly 
fluctuate and that what we eat can impact on the 
pH of blood. In reality, the body keeps blood pH 
within a tight range, and the mechanisms for 
doing so have nothing to do with digestion.

CAN DIET IMPROVE FERTILITY?  
Diet can improve fertility in both men and women. What you eat affects  
the quality of sperm and eggs and regulates hormones, including those  
that facilitate pregnancy. But other lifestyle factors are also crucial.
Getting pregnant isn’t as simple as it sounds. 
Multiple factors can affect fertility, including stress 
or lack of exercise or sleep. Along with a good diet, 
people wanting to maximize their fertility need a lot 
of fresh air, exercise, and rest.
If you smoke, stop! It is linked to reduced fertility 
in both women and men. Also, avoid or reduce 
caffeine (stick to 1–2 cups per day at most), and  
avoid alcohol altogether. 
Exercise is important not just because it promotes 
physical vigor and mental health but also because it 
helps maintain a healthy body weight, which could 
improve fertility. 
In women, being very low or high in weight can 
impact fertility. At the higher end of the spectrum, 
excess fat increases estrogen levels, which could lead 
to irregular cycles and missed ovulation. At the  
low end, the body may shut down the reproductive 
system to preserve fuel for essential body processes. 
In men, obesity affects the molecular and physical 
structure of sperm and is linked to reduced fertility.
HOW TO EAT
A varied and balanced diet promotes fertility.  
Keep in mind the two Qs—quality and quantity. 
Focus on nutritional content and the portion that’s 
right for you, rather than the number of calories.
I am an advocate of the Mediterranean diet  
(see pages 36–39)—minus the red wine for women. 
Research indicates that women with this pattern  
of eating have a 66 percent lower risk of  
experiencing infertility.
Women should supplement their diet with folic 
acid (see left) and vitamin D during the winter 
months (or all year round if sun exposure is limited). 
Take 10μg daily from September to March.
Men can improve sperm quality by including 
meat, shellfish, nuts, and whole grains in their diet 
(the Mediterranean diet incorporates these). Bear in 
mind that a high intake of processed and red meat by 
men has been shown to reduce rates of conception.
Certain nutrients are known to influence fertility 
in men. The body requires selenium (found in Brazil 
nuts, fish, meat, and eggs) to make healthy sperm. 
Low levels of zinc have been linked to reduced 
testosterone levels, so it’s important to keep zinc 
levels topped off, preferably through diet. Omega-3 
fatty acids, found in oily fish, help produce 
prostaglandins, compounds that are important  
for making sperm.
Folate and folic acid
IT’S IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN TO CONSUME 
DIETARY FOLATE AND ALSO SUPPLEMENT DURING 
PRECONCEPTION AND EARLY PREGNANCY.
Folate (vitamin B9) improves the quality and 
maturation of eggs, helps the body make healthy 
blood cells, and enables an embryo’s brain, skull, 
and spinal cord to develop properly (avoiding 
neural tube defects such as spina bifida). Ensure 
your diet is rich in folate, which is found in dark 
green leafy veggies like broccoli and spinach and in 
many legumes, including chickpeas. Folic acid is 
the synthetic version. If planning to conceive, build 
up stores by taking a 400mcg dose daily three 
months before you begin trying. Continue 
supplementing until week 12 of pregnancy.

WHY IS NUTRITION  
SO IMPORTANT DURING 
PREGNANCY?
Leading child health experts worldwide agree that care given from conception to a 
child’s second birthday—the first 1,000 days—has more influence on a child’s future 
than any other time in their life, and this includes what the mother’s diet looks like.
A mother’s diet and her nutrient stores are the only 
source of nutrition for a developing baby, so it is 
critical that women get the health care and nutritious 
food they need before and during pregnancy.
CRUCIAL TRIMESTERS
During the three trimesters of pregnancy, a woman’s 
diet, weight fluctuations, physical and mental well-
being, environment, and lifestyle habits can have a 
huge impact on her child’s future health. These 
factors influence how a child’s metabolism, immune 
system, and organ function begin to develop, not  
to mention the outcome of whether a child is born 
prematurely or at a low birth weight, which may 
have a lasting impact on a child’s health well into 
adulthood. The vitamins, nutrients, and calorie 
intake needed vary depending on the trimester.
A growing body of research suggests that diseases 
later in life such as diabetes, hypertension, and 
stroke have their origins in the womb—and that 
prenatal nutrition plays an important role in whether 
a child becomes susceptible to these and other 
illnesses later in life.
But pregnancy can be tough: aversions to food,  
no appetite, a large appetite, reflux, sickness—you 
name it; most women will have some kind of food 
challenge throughout those nine months when the 
baby is growing. The good news is that as long as 
you avoid certain risky foods and drinks (see  
pages 182–185), enjoy a generally healthy diet and 
lifestyle, and pay attention to particular nutrients 
that are key to a baby’s development—especially 
their brain (see below and right)—you should have 
little to worry about.
Building the brain
The following key 
nutrients have been 
studied and linked 
with development  
of the baby’s brain 
in the womb. Before 
taking supplements, 
speak to a health 
professional.
FOOD SOURCES
EGGS  |  LEAN MEATS |  POULTRY  |  CRUCIFEROUS 
VEGETABLES (BRASSICAS)  |  NUTS  |  LEGUMES
SHOULD I SUPPLEMENT?
Supplementing with twice the recommended 
amount of choline (930mg/day) in the third 
trimester of pregnancy may improve speed 
of processing in infants; especially 
important for plant-based eaters.
FOOD SOURCES
Limited but include oily fish, egg yolks, meat 
and offal, fortified foods, and mushrooms 
grown in sunlight (see pages 138–139). 
SHOULD I SUPPLEMENT?
If you get little or no sun exposure, take a daily 
10mcg supplement all year. Deficiency in 
pregnancy has been linked to an increased 
risk of a child developing ADHD and a 
reduction in IQ and language abilities.
CHOLINE
VITAMIN D

Brain development  A child’s  
brain begins to grow very early on  
in pregnancy and develops at an 
astonishing speed. The nutrition that 
a baby gets from its mother through 
her diet is the fuel that drives much 
of this incredible transformation.
Brain food  Omega-3 fatty acids  
and vitamin D have been identified as 
some of the most important nutrients 
in supporting brain development. 
Seafood is a key food source for both.

WHAT FOODS SHOULD I  
AVOID DURING PREGNANCY?
Pregnancy can be a very exciting but also anxious time for expectant moms,  
with many conflicting messages on the internet or from others on what you  
should and shouldn’t be eating. So what is safe, and what is not?
Most foods that pregnant women are advised to 
avoid carry a risk of food poisoning from harmful 
bacteria when undercooked or prepared in a certain 
way. The current US guidelines are as follows:
PREPARED FOOD
  Premade deli salads: Don’t buy or eat premade 
ham salad, chicken salad, or seafood salad, which 
may contain Listeria—bacteria that can cause an 
infection called listeriosis, which can harm a fetus or 
newborn. These items are commonly found in delis.
  Unwashed packaged salad: It is fine to eat 
preprepared, prewashed salad if you keep it in  
the fridge and eat it before the use-by date. 
Avoid eating raw sprouts of any kind (including 
alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean).
  Pâté: Avoid all types of pâté, as they may  
contain Listeria.
DAIRY AND EGGS
  Unpasteurized milk and dairy: Most milk and 
dairy products, including cheese, sold in the US  
are pasteurized and safe to consume—but avoid 
unpasteurized (raw) milk and dairy. If you only have 
access to unpasteurized milk, boil it before using.
  Raw or undercooked eggs: Cook eggs until  
the yolks and whites are firm. If you are making a 
casserole or other dish containing eggs, make sure 
the dish is cooked to a temperature of 160°F. Try to 
avoid foods that contain raw egg, such as homemade 
mayonnaise or mousse. Make sure that foods that 
contain raw or lightly cooked eggs are made only 
with pasteurized eggs.
MEAT
  Raw or undercooked meat: Avoid any 
undercooked meat, especially poultry, pork,  
sausages, and burgers. Meat should always be  
Some cheeses are safe to eat 
when pregnant, but not all  
of them, as some contain 
unpasteurized dairy and are 
more susceptible to bacterial 
growth. This breakdown  
shows which types are safe  
and which are best to avoid.

more moisture, 
making it easier 
for bacteria  
to grow
Avoid these types  
of cheese unless 
cooked until  
steaming hot,  
as they can  
cause listeriosis.
Vitamin A
TOO MUCH VITAMIN A CAN BE HARMFUL TO AN UNBORN BABY, 
POTENTIALLY LEADING TO BIRTH DEFECTS AND EVEN MISCARRIAGE. 
Avoid liver and liver products and multivitamins containing vitamin A or 
fish liver oils. It’s fine to eat foods that naturally contain low levels of 
vitamin A, like carrots, but avoid any that have vitamin A added. Cosmetic 
products, like face cream, that contain vitamin A are safe to use.
AVOID UNLESS COOKED
cooked thoroughly and not be pink or bloody,  
as there is a risk of toxoplasmosis, a parasitic  
infection that can be harmful to you and your baby. 
It’s safe to eat cold, prepackaged meat such as 
ham. You may prefer to avoid raw cured meats;  
if not, freeze for four days before defrosting  
or eat them cooked. Avoid game, as it may  
contain lead shot.
FISH
  Some fish: Pregnant women should eat  
a diverse diet that includes 8-12oz of low-
mercury fish weekly to help boost omega-3 
consumption. All seafood dishes should be 
cooked to 145°F.
  Raw shellfish: Cooked shellfish is safe, 
but raw shellfish can cause food poisoning.

WHY DO WOMEN GET  
STRANGE FOOD CRAVINGS  
IN PREGNANCY?
We’ve all heard stories of the unusual items or food combinations 
women want to eat while pregnant. In truth, there is very little research  
on the subject and a lot of old wives’ tales.
Some women crave unhealthy items during 
pregnancy, while the lucky few experience healthier 
cravings for fruits and vegetables. Others have no 
appetite at all. We don’t know much about why this 
happens, but cravings may be caused by hormonal 
changes, physiological changes, or even the 
emotional roller coaster of pregnancy.
POTENTIAL CAUSES
The nausea and sickness some women experience 
during pregnancy is incredibly taxing on the body. 
Sometimes food cravings can materialize as a 
coping strategy and a way to manage hormonal 
fluctuations or difficult moments. There has also 
been talk of women “needing” certain vitamins

================================================================================
WHAT SHOULD  
I DRINK DURING 
PREGNANCY?
Staying hydrated is vital during pregnancy. You’ll 
need seven to 10 glasses of fluid a day—possibly 
more if you’re active or the weather is hot—but  
be mindful of what you are drinking.
Try to get your fluid intake from a variety of sources. 
Remember your limits with each type (see below)  
and avoid too many sugary drinks, as flavor preferences  
can be developed in the womb (see pages 186–187).
LIMIT CAFFEINE
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) warns that  
too much caffeine can result in miscarriage or a low birth 
weight. The NIH advises pregnant women to drink no 
more than two mugs of regular coffee, or less than 
200mg of caffeine, per day. Research suggests that the 
amount of caffeine in coffee can range from 50mg per 
cup to more than 300mg, while other foods, such as 
chocolate, and medications also contain caffeine, so it 
would be easy to exceed the recommended limit without 
realizing. Ask about caffeine content before you buy.  
If unknown, it is best to avoid. Note also that green  
tea contains up to 100mg caffeine, and some herbal  
teas may not be fully safe in large amounts.
AVOID ALCOHOL
It is safest to avoid alcohol completely during pregnancy; 
it has been linked to low birth weight, premature birth, 
and miscarriage. It can also affect a baby’s development 
and long-term health. Experts cannot be sure that any 
amount of alcohol is safe, but drinking heavily during 
pregnancy can result in your baby developing fetal 
alcohol syndrome (FAS), a serious condition with 
symptoms including growth, learning, and behavioral 
issues. If you are finding it difficult to stop drinking,  
ask for support from your midwife or OB. 
and minerals and therefore craving foods  
that contain them. However, if you have  
a craving for less healthy options, it’s 
unlikely that your body is trying to meet a 
nutritional need. If that were the case, you 
would be more likely to crave foods such as 
fish, broccoli, and whole grains, which many 
in the US don’t eat enough of.
BEST PRACTICE
It’s good to be aware of what your body is 
telling you, but it’s also important not to 
always give in to food cravings, as your diet 
during pregnancy needs to 
be varied to provide all the 
nutrients your baby needs.

DO A CHILD’S FOOD 
PREFERENCES DEVELOP  
IN THE WOMB?
There has been a lot of research into the nutrition a baby receives  
from its mother inside the womb and through breast milk, and  
the results are fascinating.
Early exposure Babies can 
detect particularly strong 
flavors such as garlic in 
amniotic fluid and breast 
milk and can develop 
preferences accordingly.
Research suggests that babies start  
to develop preferences for certain 
flavors in the womb, delivered via  
the amniotic fluid, and then via 
breastfeeding, with potential 
implications for lifelong eating habits. 
It is a tricky area to research ethically 
when it comes to a poor diet and the 
impact on a baby’s future health, but we 
know that the most researched flavors that are 
easily available in amniotic fluid and breast milk  
are garlic, carrot, alcohol, anise, and vanilla.
INNATE PREFERENCES
Around 16 weeks after conception, fetuses develop 
pores on their taste buds that allow them to identify 
basic tastes, and they will swallow more amniotic 
fluid when it’s sweet and less when it’s bitter. 
Penchants for salt and umami tastes are also innate. 
Available data suggests that infants are born  
“hard-wired” to prefer tastes that signal beneficial 
nutrients (for example, sweet tastes signal calories) 
and to reject tastes that signal harmful compounds 
(for example, bitter tastes signal poison). 
LEARNED PREFERENCES
Most of our food preferences, however, are learned, 
and a growing body of research shows that this 
learning also begins before birth. From as early as  
21 weeks old the fetus can detect complex flavors,

Taste development  
in unborn babies
Taste and flavor 
perception are central  
to the development of  
food preferences. Both 
begin in the womb  
due to changes in the 
gustatory and olfactory 
system, beginning in  
the first trimester of 
pregnancy.
Olfactory bulb and  
nerves detect all smells
Orthonasal olfaction 
senses smells rising  
from the nasal cavity
Retronasal olfaction  
senses smells rising  
from the oral cavity
Sensor cells in the  
tongue identify tastes
such as garlic and carrot, a few hours after the 
mother has eaten those foods. This can result in 
preferences for these flavors at birth through breast 
milk and weaning. For example, babies who tasted  
high concentrations of carrot in utero and in their 
mother’s milk went on to happily eat more carrots 
during weaning. However, this has also been shown 
to ring true with unhealthy items. The more little 
ones are exposed in the womb to less healthy foods, 
the more desensitized they may become to it when 
older, meaning they may eat more cake, chocolate, 
and chips to get the same reward centers to light up.
BEST PRACTICE
It makes sense to eat a varied diet when pregnant 
and nursing to enhance the likelihood that your 
baby will eat a wider variety of foods, but fear not  
if this has not been an option for you. There is 
ample opportunity to improve this during the 
weaning stage (see pages 194–195). Exposing your 
baby to a variety of novel foods in infancy will 
reduce the likelihood of them developing a 
neophobia or aversion to foods later on in life.
Taste sensations result from 
activation of the gustatory system—
taste cells in the mouth, neural 
pathways, and the gustatory cortex 
in the brain—and are limited  
to sweet, bitter, sour, salty,  
and umami.

THE SYNTHESIS 
OF FLAVOR
Thousands of different  
odors stimulate the olfactory

cavity to create smell  
sensations.
Flavor perception then results  
from the integration of the taste  
and smell sensory systems.  
Odors sensed orthonasally and 
retronasally combine with tastes 
detected in the oral cavity to  
create flavor sensations.

WILL MY CHILD DEVELOP  
FOOD ALLERGIES?
Food allergies affect 32 million Americans, including 5.6 million children  
under age 18. That’s about 1 in 13 children, or two in every classroom.
Importantly, if you have a food allergy, that doesn’t 
mean your baby will, but there is a higher chance  
of that allergy being present, as the likelihood can  
be down to genetics. If a parent or sibling has a food 
allergy or eczema or asthma, the risk increases for  
a child to have a food allergy.
DURING PREGNANCY
There is no firm evidence that eliminating certain 
foods from the diet during pregnancy has any 
impact on the development of future allergies; it may 
even have a detrimental effect, causing deficiencies

SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT TAKING A

probiotic to choose, so be cautious when taking  
any supplements.
in key nutrients for mother or baby. Some research 
has suggested that taking omega-3 supplements may 
reduce the risk, but the results are not conclusive.
DURING INFANCY
While there is no one food or diet that can eliminate 
the risk of an allergy, it is thought that exclusively 
breastfeeding for the first six months of the baby’s 
life can reduce the risk. Some allergies, such as eggs 
and milk, can disappear as a child grows up, but 
some, like peanuts, can be lifelong. If you have any 
concerns, speak to your health professional before 
starting to wean.
PEANUT ALLERGIES
In the US, peanuts are deemed safe to eat during 
pregnancy. Government advice used to be to avoid 
giving foods containing peanuts to children under 
three, but the latest research shows no clear evidence 
that this reduces the risk and may in fact increase 
risk (see below), so peanuts—ground or in a butter 
due to the risk of choking on whole nuts—should 
not be avoided, unless the child has a known allergy.
LEAP peanut study
A LEAP study looked at peanut allergies  
in children, as numbers have risen in the 
last 10 years. They recruited 640 babies 
aged 4–11 months with eczema and/or an 
egg allergy, as this increases the risk of 
having a peanut allergy. Results showed 
a reduced risk in babies who ate peanuts.

SHOULD I CHANGE MY NUTRITION  
AFTER GIVING BIRTH?
The period after giving birth is an opportunity for the mother to be looked after  
and to recover. Key to that process is making sure she gets the right nutrition.
Keeping up with the demands of feeding while 
sleep-deprived and trying to recover from the birth 
is hard. For many women, it can take several months 
to adjust. To help restore health, replenish nutrient 
stores, and, if breastfeeding, support lactation, new 
mothers should eat nourishing foods that meet their 
body’s changing needs.
POSTPARTUM NUTRITION
New moms should eat and drink regularly, following 
a healthy, balanced diet. This should include lots of 
fruits and vegetables, as well as proteins to help the 
body recover, fiber-rich carbohydrates for energy, 
and iron-rich foods to help create new blood cells—
especially if the mother has anemia or lost a lot of 
blood during the birth. They will need on average 
between 1,800 and 2,200 calories a day, and 500 
calories more than this if breastfeeding.
NUTRIENTS FOR BREASTFEEDING
Breastfeeding moms should limit their intake of 
alcohol and caffeine, as these can pass into breast 
milk and affect the baby’s digestion, sleep, and 
feeding. They should also be aware of the following 
additional nutritional needs during this period:
  Increased calcium: An extra 550mg per day  
is required to support milk production and replenish 
calcium stores. Include calcium-rich foods in your 
diet, e.g., milk, cheese, yogurts. If your diet is  
plant-based (see pages 116–133), choose calcium-
enriched options.
  Increased zinc: An extra 4mg per day is  
required if breastfeeding. Zinc supports the immune 
system and is found in beef, fish, beans, tofu, nuts, 
and seeds.
  Omega-3s: Evidence suggests that a diet rich  
in omega-3s results in omega-3-rich breast milk, 
which supports brain development in babies. 
Sources include some nuts and seeds and oily  
fish (see pages 184–185).
  Increased fluids: You will need to drink more 
fluids, remembering to do so before a headache 
begins. The amount needed will vary, but the 
Institute of Medicine recommends 14–16 cups  
of water per day.

================================================================================
190
HOW CAN I GIVE MY CHILD THE 
BEST NUTRITIONAL START?
Once born, babies reach a range of milestones as they continue to grow and develop, 
but it’s important to provide them with the right nutrition to do so from day one.
Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a 
baby’s life is recommended, as the mother’s milk 
contains all the nutrients her infant needs. But if 
this isn’t possible, formula—which mimics the 
nutrition of breast milk—should be used instead. 
It’s important to note that however you decide to 
feed your baby is your choice. 
BREASTFEEDING
Breastfeeding is the most nutritious, cost-effective, 
and often the most convenient option for feeding a 
baby. Breast milk contains a variety of nutrients and 
proteins, as well as growth factors, antibodies, and 
hormones vital to a baby’s development that cannot 
be replicated in infant formula. Breast milk and the 
process of feeding is also critical to the seeding of a 
baby’s gut microbiome (see pages 140–141). Thanks 
to the mother-to-child interaction, breastfeeding also 
plays an important role in strengthening a baby’s 
sensory and emotional circuitry, critical for cognitive 
and socio-emotional development. Research also 
suggests breastfeeding may lower the mother’s risk 
of developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, 
cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and obesity.
How breast milk is made 
Hormonal changes caused 
by the different stages  
of pregnancy and birth 
kick-start the production  
of breast milk.
Estrogen and  
progesterone levels  
increase during pregnancy, 
stimulating the alveoli  
cells and milk ducts in  
the breast to grow
DURING 
PREGNANCY
AT BIRTH
Prolactin hormone, 
released once the  
baby is born, triggers  
the alveoli cells to

released when the baby 
suckles, causing the muscles 
around the alveoli cells to

HOW DOES NUTRITION AFFECT CHILD DEVELOPMENT? 191
WHAT IS COLOSTRUM?
The first milk a mother produces in the days after 
giving birth is literally golden—it’s called colostrum 
and is particularly rich and concentrated to give the 
baby the best possible start. 
Colostrum is packed with protein, antibodies, and 
vitamins A, D, and B12, which are all important in 
supporting the baby’s growth and immune system.
After a few days, the mother begins to produce 
“mature” breast milk, which is less concentrated  
and lower in protein and antibodies than colostrum 
but higher in fat and lactose (see above).
THE BENEFITS OF BREAST MILK
As well as providing essential nutrition from  
protein, lactose, fats, vitamins, and minerals,  
breast milk boasts numerous other health benefits.
Breastfeeding transfers vital antibodies from 
mother to child to support their immune system, 
reducing the risk of illness and sudden infant  
death syndrome (SIDS), as well as that of obesity 
and cardiovascular disease in adulthood.
Many of the body’s hormones, which are vital  
for regulating bodily functions, growth, appetite,  
and weight, are transmitted from mother to baby 
through breast milk. Studies have shown that breast 
milk contains diverse gut bacteria, which transfer  
to the baby via breastfeeding and areolar skin 
contact, seeding a healthy gut microbiome.
FORMULA
For a variety of reasons, breastfeeding may not be  
an option for you, and there is absolutely no need 
to feel guilty about that—it does not mean your 
baby has to miss out. Formula milks today have  
been designed to give all the key nutrition babies 
need. Formula comes fortified with essential 
vitamins, so whereas all breastfed babies should 
be given a daily supplement of vitamin D (400 IU) 
from birth, babies who are given more than 17oz 
(500ml) of infant formula a day do not need this.

At six months, a baby’s stores of nutrients such  
as iron, start to deplete, so guidelines recommend 
that weaning (the introduction of “solid” foods; see 
pages 192–193) should start at around this time.  
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 
that exclusively or mostly breastfed babies be given 
an iron supplement starting at 4 months of age.  
Talk to your baby’s healthcare provider about 
supplementation.

WHAT ARE THE BEST  
STRATEGIES FOR WEANING?
A baby’s first taste experiences can set them up for a great relationship with  
food. Traditionally, babies are given fruit purées as first foods, but research suggests 
that offering a variety of flavors encourages an acceptance of variety.
There’s nothing wrong with the fruit-purées-first 
approach. Babies have an innate preference for sweet 
foods (see page 194). I suggest making weaning all 
about experimentation and exposure to lots of foods 
to help your child become accustomed to as many 
flavors as possible. If you start weaning with savory 
flavors, you enable your child to learn to accept 
them and enjoy savory foods before they have a 
chance to associate solid food very firmly with sweet 
flavors (which they are predisposed to, as the flavor 
of milk is sweet). This vegetable-led approach to 
weaning is by no means the only way to wean, but  
it is backed by scientific research that shows it can 
have a positive influence on vegetable intake. 
Research suggests that, between the ages of 6  
and 12 months, babies are most likely to accept new 
foods. This gives you the ideal window to introduce 
a variety of foods into your baby’s diet. This 
nutritional input will support their development, 
and the familiarity with multiple flavors will help 
set them up with good dietary habits for life. 
Regardless of the method you choose, repeated 
exposure is vital, so be patient. It can take more  
than 10 attempts with the same food for it to 
become accepted regularly. Just keep offering.
And remember, babies have off days, too. Your baby 
won’t want the same amount of food every day. Heat, 
teething, sickness, and tiredness all affect appetite.
PURÉES OR FINGER FOODS?
Parents following a baby-led approach to weaning 
bypass purées and offer finger foods from the start, 
encouraging their baby to feed themselves (once 
they can sit upright and have the coordination).
Although introducing both purées and finger 
foods into the diet together has received mixed 
feedback, it may actually help babies develop 
Finger foods  encourage self-feeding and 
help babies improve their coordination 
and become accustomed to new textures. 
Broccoli and cauliflower “trees” are easy 
to pick up and have great textures to 
stimulate your baby’s mouth.

coordination and independence and discover what 
they like to eat best. Some people wrongly believe 
that offering a spoon alongside finger foods may 
confuse a baby and cause them to choke.
Finger foods have to be soft enough for babies  
to squash them with their gums and reduce the risk 
of choking. Ensure rough skin and hard pieces are 
removed. So if offering zucchini fingers, remove  
the skin unless it is super soft. With cucumber,  
offer just the seeds at the center.
When making purées, steam and then blend the 
food. The texture of early purées should be watery, 
like milk, then work up gradually to thicker, lumpier 
consistencies. Think of this as a gradual transition 
from puréed to mashed to minced to chopped.
MEALTIME ROUTINES
Babies thrive on routine. Within reason, try to feed 
your baby at the same times each day. You could play 
music to help build a positive association with meals. 
A pleasant routine can be reassuring, allowing you to 
expose your baby to new foods in a comfortable way. 
Eat together when you can. Good role modeling can 
encourage your baby to eat more and try new foods. 
They will even learn by watching you chew and 
swallow food.
Stay positive and calm. Don’t let your baby’s facial 
expressions affect you. Imagine experiencing a food 
for the first time—it’s likely to produce a reaction. 
This is the wonder of weaning!
Bitter flavors
INTRODUCING FOODS WITH BITTER FLAVORS 
EARLY ON MAY BE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOUR 
CHILD’S LONG-TERM HEALTH.
Research suggests that the phytonutrients found 
in bitter vegetables may help prevent heart disease 
and cancer. Try introducing more bitter veggies, like 
broccoli or Brussels sprouts, alongside less 
intensely flavored veggies like cauliflower, to 
encourage your baby to develop an acceptance of 
and a liking for their flavors and textures.

HOW DO I PREVENT MY  
CHILD FROM BECOMING  
A PICKY EATER?
A young child’s relationship with food matters. Picky eaters get less protein, 
vegetables, and fruits, and research shows that children who don’t eat well at  
the age of three are more likely to remain picky into adulthood. 
The phrase “picky eating” describes many behaviors, 
including the rejection of one or more foods, the 
limited intake or variety of foods, and/or frequent 
changes in food preferences. Causes can be difficult 
to pinpoint. Studies suggest some children are 
predisposed to food pickiness, just as others are 
more shy. Many studies show that children respond 
to their parents’ relationships with food, which gives 
parents the power to influence their child’s diet.
THINGS YOU CAN DO
Follow the advice for weaning on pages 192–193  
to establish good eating habits early. As often as 
possible, eat together. Give your child the same  
food as the rest of the family (minus the salt).  
The best way for them to learn to eat and enjoy new 
foods is to copy you. Give your child small portions 
and a lot of praise for eating, even if it’s only a little. 
If they reject a food, don’t force them to eat it. Just 
take it away without saying anything and try it again 
another time. Changing how you serve a food may 
make it more appealing. For instance, a child might 
refuse cooked carrots but enjoy raw grated carrot.
Your child may be a slow eater, so be patient.  
Make mealtimes enjoyable and not just about eating. 
Sit down and chat about other things to give them  
a chance to finish eating at their own pace.
Don’t give your child too many snacks— two 
healthy snacks a day is plenty. And don’t leave  
meals until your child is too hungry or tired to eat.
If you know kids who are good eaters, ask them 
over for a meal to set an example—but don’t openly 
compare them to your child. If there is an adult your 
child looks up to in your life, have them over to eat 
often. Sometimes a child will eat without fuss 
around a grandparent, for example.
WHAT NOT TO DO
Avoid showing your child a reaction if they exhibit 
picky behavior. Try to stay calm, even if it’s very 
frustrating. Reserve all your attention for verbally 
praising your child whenever they eat well.
Also avoid offering your child overwhelmingly 
huge portions. Stick with small portions, adding 
seconds if required.
Natural sweet tooth
THE PREFERENCE BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN 
SHOW FOR SWEET FLAVORS MAY BE DUE TO THE 
PAIN AND STRESS RELIEF THEY PROVIDE.
In studies, 3–4-month-old babies instantly felt 
calmer and more trusting around a new face when 
consuming something sweet. We are hardwired to 
enjoy sweet foods. They trigger the "feel-good" 
reward center in the brain and offer a plentiful 
supply of energy. As we age, our feel-good receptors 
don’t work as efficiently—we grow out of our sweet 
tooth. That being said, it’s important to set up good 
eating habits early. Offer kids sweet foods in 
moderation, ideally after establishing savory foods 
in the diet (see page 192). Avoid offering added 
sugars (see page 64) to children under two.

VITAMIN A

SOURCE  OF VITAMIN A,

EYE HEALTH AND THE 
IMMUNE SYSTEM
Don’t leave your child to eat alone. If you  
can’t eat together, stay with them while they  
eat their own meal.
Avoid using food as a reward. Your child may start 
to think of sweets as good and vegetables as bad, 
which can spiral into an unhealthy relationship with 
food. Instead, reward them with a trip to the park or 
promise to play a game with them.
It’s tempting to give kids things you know they will 
eat, and ultra-processed foods are highly palatable. 
Kids might reject foods consistently or eat them 
only sometimes. Be patient with this and play the 
long game. While a bag of chips can guarantee the 
same flavor at each bite and a child that will happily 
eat what you give them, in the long run, it may create 
a preference for less healthy foods that becomes a 
tricky habit to break.
Sweet, mild-flavored carrots are  
a popular choice for transitioning 
babies to solid food from six months 
old, but don’t be afraid to try more 
strongly flavored vegetables to help 
expand your baby’s palate.

HOW CAN I HELP MY  
TODDLER EAT WELL?
Toddlers are notorious for being up and down with their food, and this is completely 
normal. You need to support and guide your toddler to make the right nutritional 
choices, which can impact growth, development, and future health outcomes.
From ages one to three, a toddler will be learning  
to eat with hands and cutlery, in a variety of settings, 
and manage energy intake for the amount of growing  
and exploring they will do. Some children will eat 
more than others. Teething, sickness, activity levels, 
and sleep can all impact appetite.
ESTABLISH GOOD HABITS
A positive eating environment at home is key to 
encouraging good eating behaviors. Get your 
children involved with cooking so they can see  
the process from start to finish; sing songs and  
get creative to make it all the more fun.
Provide your child with exposure to lots of 
different foods. Don’t give up after introducing  
a new food once—it can take between 5 and 15  
times before they will accept a new food. Try to stay 
as relaxed as possible before and during mealtimes,  
and be a role model for eating a variety of different 
foods and having a healthy relationship toward food 
intake. The more you pressurize your child, the less 
likely they are to want to try new foods or eat their 
meal. Limit bribery, as this will only make things 
more difficult in the long run. For example, avoid 
saying, “If you eat your greens, you can have 
dessert,” or making a child feel guilty for not eating 
a food because others elsewhere have less.
Ensure your kitchen and home are full of healthy 
foods. Utilize the freezer and try batch-cooking a 
favorite meal with lots of added vegetables. For 
example, make a cauliflower mac ’n’ cheese and 
include the cauliflower stalk and leaves, along with 
broccoli, peas, and carrots, and freeze into individual 
portions for the next few weeks.
Each day toddlers need 
three meals and some 
snacks made up of the four 
main food groups, in the 
right balance and in portion 
sizes just right for them. 
For most toddlers, there is 
no need to offer low-calorie 
or low-fat options as 
children of this age need 
lots of energy for growing 
and physical activity.

Should I give 
my toddler supplements?
GOVERNMENT ADVICE IS THAT CHILDREN AGED  
SIX MONTHS TO FIVE YEARS OLD SHOULD TAKE  
A DAILY VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENT
if consuming less than 17oz (500ml) formula milk. However, 
recently it has been reported that more children are getting 
enough vitamins in their diets. With the exception of vitamin D, 
if your child has a balanced diet with lots of color and variety, 
then they will be getting enough. If you are concerned, ask your  
doctor for a referral to a pediatric dietitian.

Quantity? 
At least 12oz (350ml) of 
milk a day OR 2 servings 
of dairy foods such as 
cheese  
or yogurt.
How long? 
WHO recommends 
breastfeeding until 2 years 
old; offer cow’s milk or an 
alternative after 12 
months. 
Vegans:  
Make sure dairy 
alternatives are fortified. 
Avoid rice milk, which 
contains a level of arsenic 
too high for toddlers.
Quantity? 
Children aged 1 to 3 years  
should have no more than 
2g of salt (800mg sodium) 
per day.
Yes or no? 
There is no reason to add 
salt to your child’s diet at 
any age unless you have 
been advised to do so by 
your health professional.
Quantity? 
Avoid added sugar, except 
occasionally from 2+.
Desserts 
Include to maximize 
nutrition, but make it fruit 
and yogurt or something 
less sweet.
Drinks 
Water and milk are best as 
they do not contain added 
sugar. No milk after 
brushing teeth from 2+.
Snacks 
Avoid too much dried fruit 
as it can get stuck on 
teeth and cause decay.
Quantity? 
Until the age of 2, children 
need a lot of energy from 
fat. After that, lower-fat 
options can be offered.
Saturated fats 
Limit saturated fat to less 
than 10% of overall daily 
calories. Steam, grill, or 
bake foods instead of 
frying them to reduce 
saturated fat.
Protein 
Replace processed and 
high-fat meats with beans, 
peas, and lentils to meet 
protein needs, but be 
aware that high-fiber 
foods may fill little 
tummies too quickly.

WHAT SHOULD I CONSIDER  
IF RAISING A CHILD ON A  
VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN DIET?
Times have changed substantially in the last 20 years, and plant-based diets are on  
the rise, but what does that mean for little eaters? Is it possible to give them  
all the nutrition they require from a plant-based diet?
The short answer is “yes,” but it needs to be 
carefully thought through, with potential 
supplementation provided if on a vegan diet.
NUTRIENT DENSITY FOR VEGANS
For healthy development, a vegan child needs  
enough calories, healthy fats, and protein. Vegan 
diets can be high in fiber, which can make toddlers’ 
tummies full without sufficient calories. Guard against 
this by including energy- and nutrient-dense foods 
such as avocados, vegetable oils, seeds, nut butters  
or ground-up nuts (no whole nuts to the age of  
five, due to choking risk), tofu, and legumes.
PROTEIN CONSIDERATIONS
Protein needs are easily met if your child eats a  
wide variety of foods containing protein at each 
meal. From nondairy yogurts to beans, peas, and 
lentils, to grains like quinoa and buckwheat, to  
tofu and other soy products, there are many options  
for vegan and plant-based eaters. Alongside the 
essential amino acids we should all be consuming 
(see pages 14–15 and 128–129), there are a few more 
that are “conditionally” essential for children, since 
their bodies cannot make enough: arginine, histidine, 
cysteine, glycine, tyrosine, glutamine, and proline. 
Provided you give your child a mixture of different 
protein sources over the course of each day, 
including whole grains and vegetables, they should 
have no problem obtaining both essential and 
conditional amino acids.
VITAMINS AND MINERALS
Consider meeting with your pediatrician and 
registered dietitian to discuss whether 
supplementation is necessary:
  Iron  It’s recommended to give all exclusively 
breastfed babies 1mg per kg (2lb) of body weight  
a day from four to six months.
  Vitamin D  Guidance is to supplement with  
400 IU of vitamin D for babies who receive only 
breast milk. Babies fed only formula do not need to 
supplement since formula is fortified with vitamin D.
  Iodine  Breast milk and formula provide all 
requirements. Thereafter, it may be wise to speak  
to your pediatrician about supplementation.
  Vitamin B12  There are no quality forms of B12 
in a plant-based diet, which is vital for the nervous 
system, metabolism, and formation of red blood  
cells. Breast milk will be sufficient only if the mother 
consumes B12, and formula is fortified already.
  Choline  Important for babies’ brain growth,  
the main sources of choline are eggs, soy, and 
cruciferous vegetables.
  Omega-3  The fatty acid DHA is critical for  
brain development, but even seaweed, algae, eggs, 
and fortified foods are unlikely to provide enough,  
so consider supplements while pregnant and lactating.
  Calcium  Studies show that calcium, important 
for growing bones and teeth, can be insufficient in 
vegan diets. Aim for a variety of fortified plant-based 
sources: calcium-set tofu, calcium-fortified soy 
yogurts, baked beans, hummus, and nut butters.

DOES WHAT I EAT  
AFFECT MY MOOD?
A healthy diet can do a lot to boost your mood and sense of well-being.  
In fact, improving what you eat can lead to more positive feelings,  
clearer thinking, higher energy, and calmer moods. 
Research suggests inflammation in the brain is 
impacted by diet, since short-chain fatty acids 
produced in the gut have anti-inflammatory 
properties, and diversity of gut bacteria encourages 
production of these fatty acids (see pages 48–53).  
As a result of a poor diet high in salt, saturated  
fat, and sugars, the hippocampus in the brain 
decreases in volume and your neurons may be 
damaged. This in turn can increase the risk of 
depression, low moods, and poor memory and 
learning skills. If you aim to follow the 
Mediterranean diet (see pages 36–41), trials suggest  
this can act as a treatment for depression and in 
some cases help prevent it, often proving more 
impactful than the traditional routes of treatment.  
To protect your brain, you should also aim to eat  
more polyphenols, found in foods such as spinach 
and dark berries like blueberries.
DIET AND THE ‘‘HAPPY HORMONE’’
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps relay 
messages from one area of the brain to another and 
Blood sugar highs and lows
When you eat a lot of refined 
carbs, your pancreas sees a  
spike in blood glucose levels and 
releases insulin as quickly as it 
can to try to catch up. This can 
result in too much glucose being 
removed from your blood, causing 
a blood-sugar crash that can leave 
you feeling fatigued, irritable, 
depressed, anxious, and nervous.
Refined carbs for breakfast
Foods with little or no fiber 
(such as refined carbs and 
sugar) break down and release 
energy quickly, leading to a 
short-term spike in blood-
sugar levels
After a brief energy ‘‘high,’’  
rapid conversion of glucose  
by insulin results in a sharp 
drop in blood-sugar levels, 
leading to an energy crash  
and food cravings

is believed to influence a variety of psychological 
functions; it’s known as the “happy hormone” 
because of its mood-stabilizing qualities. Gut 
bacteria manufacture about 95 percent of the body’s 
supply of serotonin and interactions between the 
gut-brain axis (see pages 48–49), and gut bacteria 
help you out with many essential functions, such as 
digestion of nutrients, and may even be implicated 
in your mental health.
Those of us with low serotonin levels are said to 
feel better after eating sugar, which is obviously not 
the healthiest way to lift mood and often leads to 
binge eating. Instead, you might be able to help 
serotonin production by consuming plenty of 
quality carbohydrates and proteins containing the 
amino acid tryptophan, such as milk or tuna. The 
research has not yet fully determined whether this 
dietary change does improve mood, but it may be 
that not eating enough carbohydrates, for example,  
in a high-protein/high-fat diet, leads to low moods.
ENERGY AND MOOD
Mood and concentration can be heavily impacted by 
how dietary choices affect blood-sugar levels. When 
you eat carbohydrates, your body digests it, converts 
it into glucose (sugar), and sends the glucose into 
your blood. Insulin is then produced by the pancreas 
to convert that glucose into energy. 
Your blood-sugar levels are determined by the 
type of carbohydrates you eat. The wrong type  
(such as refined carbs and sugar) will send you on  
a roller-coaster ride that will give you a quick hit of 
energy, followed by a crash that will leave you feeling 
low in energy, lacking in concentration, and craving 
more energy-dense food. This is when you may want 
to reach for that cookie to give you more sugar. 
Eating the right type of slow-release carbohydrates, 
such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, however, 
will keep you safely off the roller coaster, leaving  
you feeling happier, more focused, and more 
energetic for longer (see below).
Midmorning snack 
Grabbing a sugary snack 
of more refined carbs, 
such as cake or cookies, 
to boost your energy 
levels simply repeats  
the process
Healthy lunch
A lunch of slow-release carbs 
and fiber—from whole grains, 
veggies, and lentils—takes 
longer to digest and releases 
energy slowly, resulting in 
steady blood-sugar levels
To step off the roller coaster, 
you need to bring your blood-
sugar levels onto a steadier 
curve within a narrower range 
of highs and lows

CAN INTUITIVE 
EATING HELP ME?
Adopting the intuitive-eating approach can help you reconnect with your  
internal cues, listen to your body, and focus on health instead of weight. 
Many people think intuitive eating (IE) is an all- 
or-nothing approach (much like a diet), but IE is a 
nondiet approach that helps individuals heal from 
chronic dieting. It encourages you to ditch food rules, 
respect your body, and actually enjoy food again.
CHOOSING THE CHOCOLATE
When you are constantly dieting, food choices often 
come with little enjoyment and a side of guilt, as you 
choose what you think you should be eating. 
However, this can often backfire. For example,  
you crave some chocolate, but you think, “It’s not 
healthy,” so you opt for a low-calorie snack instead. 
You feel unsatisfied after eating this snack, so you 
search for something else …  and so the pattern 
continues. If you had listened to your body and  
eaten the chocolate, you likely would have satisfied 
your stomach and not needed to overeat.

================================================================================
CAN WE EAT TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH? 205
1. 
REJECT THE  
DIET MENTALITY
Address your food rules, which can 
be influenced by external factors 
like diets and the media. If you 
have a history of disordered 
eating, they will take 
time to undo.
THE INTUITIVE EATING APPROACH IS MADE UP OF  
10 PRINCIPLES:
2. 
HONOR HUNGER
You are ‘‘allowed’’ to be hungry. 
Hunger means our body’s 
signals are working, but diets 
often require us to ignore them. 
Hunger cues include feeling 
light-headed, irritable, or 
low on energy.
6. 
DISCOVER THE 
SATISFACTION FACTOR
To eat less and feel more fulfilled, 
choose delicious foods you really 
want and will satisfy. Prioritize a 
few meals a week to focus on 
positive eating, to begin 
with.
3. 
MAKE PEACE  
WITH FOOD
Give yourself permission to eat. 
This doesn’t mean always binging 
on unhealthy foods. By allowing 
all foods, ‘‘forbidden’’ loses its 
appeal, and you strike a 
balance.
8.
ACCEPT BODY  
DIVERSITY
We come in all different shapes  
and sizes and should not sacrifice 
health to try to change our genes. 
Consider psychological 
support if you struggle 
with body image.
4. 
CHALLENGE  
THE FOOD POLICE
Call out the voice in your head 
that tries to dictate your food 
choices based on calorie 
content or ‘‘health.’. Think 
more rationally  
around food.
9. 
EXERCISE—FEEL 
THE DIFFERENCE
Movement is good for physical 
and mental health and should feel 
good. Explore different forms of 
movement that make you feel 
energized—and ditch the 
tracking devices .
5. 
RESPECT FULLNESS
There is a difference between 
feeling full and feeling satisfied. 
Check in with yourself as you  
are eating. Are you satisfied or 
getting full? Mindful eating 
might be helpful here (see 
pages 206–207).
10. 
TAKE NUTRITION 
GENTLY
You must first explore your 
relationship with food and then 
consider the basics of nutrition.  
It is important to eat for 
well-being as well as 
enjoyment.
7. 
DISASSOCIATE 
FEELINGS FROM FOOD
When comfort eating becomes 
your only coping mechanism, it 
can be problematic. Try to find 
other ways to comfort—taking 
a bath, reading a book, 
going for a walk.

================================================================================
206
CAN MINDFUL EATING HELP ME?
Too often, eating is something to get done quickly while we multitask.  
But if we take the time to develop a mindful approach to eating, 
our relationship with food can drastically improve.
Whenever we eat or drink, we have the opportunity 
to focus on the moment. Unfortunately, many of us 
don’t do this; instead, we eat while talking on the 
phone or working on the computer, barely noticing 
the taste or the amount of food we are consuming. 
With mindful eating, we direct our full awareness to 
the sensations, thoughts, and emotions that arise as 
we eat, without criticism or judgment. We notice the 
colors, shapes, fragrances, flavors, textures, and even 
sounds of our food. A big movement toward mindful 
eating has begun, suggesting that slower and  
more thoughtful eating can help combat  
weight problems and poor food choices.
AM I EATING MINDFULLY?
Do you feel in control of the decisions you make 
around food every day? When you go to the movies, 
are you aware of how much popcorn you are eating, 
or are you so distracted by the movie that you finish 
off the whole bucket, without really tasting it? Being 
aware of how you eat is key. Only then can you move 
forward and rebuild your relationship with food.  
We have taste buds for a reason, and feeling full is  
a natural sensation, so allow yourself to enjoy your 
food. This is the first step to eating mindfully.
MAKING CHANGES
Key to mindful eating is recognizing the mindless 
eating habits that we all engage in at some time or 
other. Look at the list opposite, identify which habits 
you regularly fall into, and develop strategies to 
change them. Be conscious of what, when, and how 
you eat, and take the time to appreciate your food 
and enjoy the experience as often as you can.
USING TECHNOLOGY 
at mealtimes
Watching television or  
scrolling on your phone while 
eating will distract you from 
your food. Try to put your phone 
in another room and turn off 
the TV during mealtimes.
NIGHTTIME SNACKING
Avoid skipping meals 
and make sure you eat enough 
during the day to avoid 
nighttime hunger pangs that 
interrupt your sleep. 
NO PORTION CONTROL
Piling the plate high 
when you’re hungry is easy to 
do. Try weighing ingredients 
before you cook and sticking to 
sensible portion sizes.
MOODY EATER 
when angry, bored,  
tired, or stressed
Most people comfort eat 
sometimes, but if you do this 
often, try to find other ways  
to boost your mood, such as 
exercising, taking a bath,  
or journaling.

Mindless eating habits  
to guard against
Ask yourself how often you engage in 
these mindless eating habits and whether 
you can change your behavior. You might 
not be able to avoid all of them all the 
time, but being aware of them means you 
change the areas you choose to.
EATING ON THE COUCH 
instead of at the table
The couch is a place to lounge 
and relax. Eating at the table 
will encourage a better posture 
for eating and greater attention 
to your food.
EATING OVERLY 
PROCESSED FOODS
Processed and packaged
foods have all sorts of hidden 
ingredients in them, many of 
them unhealthy. Try cooking 
from scratch as often as you 
can, so you know what’s going 
into your food.
PICKING ON FOOD 
throughout the day
Grazing all day on snacks will 
likely lead to short-term energy 
spikes followed by blood-sugar 
crashes (see pages 202–203). 
Try eating substantial meals 
with complex carbohydrates 
for a slower release of energy.
EATING ON THE GO
When you’re dashing 
from place to place, eating 
becomes an expedient rather 
than a priority. Try to stop,  
even for five minutes, to  
savor your food.
NOT CHEWING FOOD
Shoveling down food
without chewing makes it 
harder for the body to digest 
and will leave you feeling 
unsatisfied and likely to 
overeat. Try to allow sufficient 
time to enjoy your meal or 
snack, and eat slowly.
WEEKEND EATER 
You’re good all week, then  
it goes out the window on  
the weekend
Give yourself permission to eat 
more freely all the time, rather 
than being restrictive during 
the week and binge eating on 
the weekend.
SKIPPING BREAKFAST
This can seem like a quick fix 
if you’re in a hurry or looking to 
cut down on food intake, but 
taking time for a healthy 
breakfast will set you up for  
the day with slow-release 
energy and prevent you from 
overeating at lunch.
EATING WHATEVER 
is in the office that  
day at your desk
Sometimes convenience wins, 
but try to deliberately choose 
food you want to eat, and step 
away from your desk and any 
other distractions to enjoy it.

if necessary.

See pages 96–97. Eat three 
balanced meals a day and 
two to three snacks; enough

HOW CAN I STOP  
BINGE EATING?
Binge eating is often explained as eating when we’re not hungry or  
overeating to provide a temporary distraction from something painful. But the 
relationship between food and mood goes far beyond that specific moment.
Emotional eating is often a way of compensating  
for a lack of coping skills. And for some, this pattern 
can become a compulsion. It’s important to note 
that binge-eating disorder is a serious mental  
illness where people who eat large quantities of  
food can feel like they are out of control, which  
can be incredibly distressing. Binges can leave the 
individual feeling disconnected from what they’re 
doing during a binge. They can even forget what 
they have eaten afterward.
AM I BINGE EATING? 
Everyone is an emotional eater to some degree. 
Stress, boredom, anxiety, or sleep-deprivation can 
make us want to eat more of different foods (or not 
eat). The problem occurs when our emotions rule 
how we eat. If we overeat in response to something 
difficult or painful, we can get caught in the binge-
restrict cycle (see left). A binge is followed by guilt, 
even shame and embarrassment, which can cause an 
individual to restrict their food intake to compensate. 
Restriction triggers obsessive thoughts of food and 
so the cycle begins again. If you can spend time 
developing new coping strategies for emotional 
issues, it may help you get to the core of what is 
really going on and beat the binge-restrict cycle.
If you believe you’re suffering from any form of 
disordered eating, you should seek professional help 
at the earliest opportunity. Your doctor should be 
your first point of contact as they can refer you to a 
qualified health professional. Alternatively, seek 
support from a registered therapist.
Challenge negative thoughts.  
Consider naming that inner critic  
inside your head. You may be surprised  
to find that you are bullying yourself— 
a sign that some self-soothing  
is required.
Identify your triggers.  
See whether you can recognize  
yourself in any of the common binge 
eating triggers below and think about how 
these states might affect you throughout 
your day: Anger | Anxiety | Worry |  
Fear Depression | Negativity |  
Boredom Guilt | Shame
Be kind to yourself.  
Remember that your body needs  
food for fuel. If your body is receiving  
the nutrition it needs, you are less  
likely to suffer from ill health. You  
deserve to eat and enjoy food.

AM I SUFFERING FROM 
DISORDERED EATING?
An eating disorder is a complex mental illness and is often deeply  
misunderstood. Anyone, of any gender, age, ethnicity, shape, and size,  
can get one—they do not discriminate.
A healthy relationship with food enables you to eat  
a variety of foods in a flexible and spontaneous way. 
This relationship can look different to us all, but 
ultimately it means that food does not interfere  
with your life and you do not have to live by certain 
dietary rules, such as only eating carbohydrates if 
you have exercised that day.
WHAT IS DISORDERED EATING?
People with eating disorders use disordered eating  
as a way of coping with difficult situations or 
feelings. This behavior can include limiting food 
intake; eating very large quantities of food at once; 
getting rid of eaten food through unhealthy means 
(e.g., vomiting, misusing laxatives, fasting, or 
exercising excessively); or a combination of these.
There’s no single cause, and sufferers might not 
have all the symptoms of any one eating disorder. 
Perhaps the most commonly recognized is anorexia 
nervosa, but you don’t have to be underweight to 
have anorexia. And you can develop symptoms of 
one eating disorder that then change over time and 
transform into another; for example, symptoms of 
anorexia can develop into a diagnosis for bulimia. 
Stereotypes about those who get eating disorders 
might make them even harder to spot among older 
people, men and boys, and ethnic and cultural 
minority groups. Many people are diagnosed  
with “other specified feeding or eating disorder” 
(OSFED), which means their symptoms don’t 
exactly match what doctors check for to diagnose 
binge-eating disorder, anorexia, or bulimia, but  
that doesn’t mean that it’s not still very serious.
BEHAVIORAL SIGNS
   Spending a lot of time worrying  
about your weight and body shape
   Avoiding socializing when you think  
food will be involved
   Eating very little food 
   Making yourself vomit or taking  
laxatives after you eat
   Exercising too much
   Having very strict habits or routines  
around food
   Changes in your mood, such as being  
withdrawn, anxious, or depressed
PHYSICAL SIGNS 
   Feeling cold, tired, or dizzy
   Pains, tingling, or numbness in your  
arms and legs (poor circulation)
   Racing heartbeat, fainting, or  
feeling faint
   Problems with your digestion, such  
as bloating, constipation, or diarrhea
   Your weight being very high or very low  
for someone of your age and height
   Not getting your period or other delayed  
signs of puberty

================================================================================
CAN WE EAT TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH? 211
WHAT HELP CAN I GET?
If you suspect you have an eating disorder, try  
to see your primary care physician (PCP) right 
away—the sooner, the better. Ask for a double 
appointment to give you time to talk. You can 
bring a support person, though some PCPs may 
ask to speak to you alone for some of the time. 
Give as much information as possible; try noting 
symptoms and concerns ahead of time. Your PCP 
should refer you to a specialist who can assess 
your needs and develop a plan for treatment. 
Sometimes people think their eating disorder isn’t 
serious enough and don’t want to waste people’s 
time; or they feel guilty, ashamed, or embarrassed. 
PCPs don’t specialize in eating disorders and 
may harbor misconceptions. Look for local 
support groups that can help you get connected 
to help. If a referral to a specialist isn’t the result 
of your appointment, you have the right to ask to 
see a different PCP. Don’t be daunted and don’t 
give up; you deserve treatment, and research 
suggests recovery is possible at any time.

AUTHOR’S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Although writing a few words will never repay the 
faith so many people have shown in me, I hope it goes 
some way to telling them how forever grateful I am.
Of course, thank you to everyone at DK for inviting 
me on such an inspiring project. It’s an honor to 
work with such a dedicated publisher that shares my 
passion for evidence-based advice. It has been a real 
pleasure to work with you, Alastair, Katie, and Dawn. 
The extraordinary contribution of editors Andrea, 
Holly, Salima, and Megan in refining my work 
deserves an immense thanks. It must also be said, the 
truly outstanding quality of this book is its design, 
with special thanks to Alison for being so innovative. 
It is my earliest teachers, who fostered such a 
respect and passion for science, without whom I 
would not be who I am or doing what I do. In 
particular, I would like to thank Dr. Sue Reeves, 
Kirsty Cotton, and The University of Roehampton, 
all instrumental in launching my nutrition career.
Thanks to all those who took the time out of their 
busy schedules to read and critically review every 
page; my mentor Jennifer Low, my amazing gut 
health dietitian Kaitlin Colucci, my sports 
nutritionist Faye Townsend, intuitive eating 
nutritionist Sophie Bertrand, and medical review  
by Dr. P.—your stamp of approval means so much 
more knowing how close a friend you are to me.
To my remarkable Rhitrition team: Bea, Jen, 
Kaitlin, Faye, Sophie, Sarah, Caff, Hala, Katie,  
and Victoria. The only thing that makes me prouder 
than all the good we’ve done together is the  
thought of all the remarkable things you’ll  
achieve from here.
I also want to thank my husband and son, you 
bring with you endless joy and love. You have been 
there for me through the toughest of pandemic 
times. Juggling motherhood and business in 
lockdown seemed impossible, but you help me 
believe that I can achieve anything I set my  
mind to and make me an infinitely better person.
Last but not least, I would like to thank all of  
you out there. Whether by following me @Rhitrition, 
buying a book, or seeing me in clinic, you are  
showing how much you value science. Amidst a 
confusing postpandemic time, this feels more 
important now than ever, I know you have all been 
through hardships. That’s also why I leave writing 
this book even more optimistic about our health  
than I was when I started. Because I know this  
book will not only help so many people; it will 
inspire more to believe you can make a difference  
to your health and that of the planet, too, knowing 
nutrition is a science.

PREFACE 
My fascination with brawn began almost thirty years ago when I came across an old 
VHS copy of the now classic documentary ‘Pumping Iron.’ As I watched Arnold 
Schwarzenegger compete with Lou Ferrigno for the title of Mr. Olympia, my eyes were 
virtually glued to the screen for ninety minutes.  Once it was over, the ﬁrst thing I wanted 
to do was to grab my gym clothes, drink a protein shake (which, thanks to inspiration 
from the movie “Rocky,” consisted of six raw eggs in a tall glass) and run as fast as I 
could to the local gym (which was incidentally ten miles away!). At the age of twelve, 
however, this would prove to be a diﬃcult feat.  
Nevertheless, I knew from that moment onwards that weight training was going to be an 
integral part of my life in one way or another. When I was sixteen years old, my close 
friend introduced me to a new gymnasium that opened up in our neighbourhood. I was 
ﬁnally ‘old enough’ to begin my weight lifting journey. Within six months, I was hooked 
and since then, I’ve never looked back. I still lift weights on a regular basis (three to ﬁve 
days a week) and will continue to do so for as long as I’m able.   
As you can no doubt imagine, my twenty-ﬁve year love aﬀair with weight training, food, 
nutrition, and exercise has consisted of many peaks and troughs. During this time, 
however, I’ve trained alongside many professional athletes, bodybuilders, power-lifters 
and even yoga teachers. In so doing, I was in a position to ‘pick their brains’ and learn 
about what training regime worked best for them. As time moved on, my passion for 
weight training and sports nutrition grew stronger and stronger, and the thought of going 
to university and studying these topics further became appealing to me. My dream 
came true in 1995 when I was accepted into King’s College London. In 1999, I 
graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Nutrition and Medical Sciences. I later 
studied Dentistry at Guy’s Hospital, London and qualiﬁed a few years afterwards as a 
dental surgeon. In total, my time at university spanned eight years allowing me enough 
time to further my knowledge base with regards to sports nutrition, dentistry and 
medicine.  
In the beginning of 2009, my father became very ill. A few weeks later, he was 
diagnosed with stomach cancer. This news came as a massive and terrifying shock to 
me and my family. I personally found this dark time in my life extremely diﬃcult to come 
to terms with. I could not understand how such a thing could happen to someone who 
had led an active life, was physically strong, who’d never smoked a cigarette in his life, 
and rarely drank alcohol. Up until that point, my father was the spitting image of health. 
Ironically, my siblings and I would refer to him as ‘Superman’ on occasion because we’d 
never known him to be sick. This is why it came as an additional shock to the family 
when he passed away later on during that year.  
His death forced me to look into risk factors which may help explain why an apparently 
healthy  individual, like my father, could fall victim to such a tragic and debilitating 
!IV

================================================================================
illness. Then one day, whilst reading an article in a magazine, I came across an 
advertisement with the slogan “You are what you eat!” These ﬁve words served as a 
‘eureka’ moment because they allowed me to concentrate less on common 
environmental factors that often play a role in Western diseases (such as emotional 
stress, pollution, smoking and so on) and shift the focus more towards dietary factors. 
Despite the fact that he took pride in his physical appearance, my father did not have 
the best diet in the world. He would rarely eat enough fruits and vegetables, for 
instance, and frequently consumed foods that were either fried or heavily processed. In 
addition, he would exercise less frequently and start eating more ‘take away’ meals as 
he got older. 
In retrospect, it is my strong belief that the combination of a poor overall diet, in 
conjunction with insuﬃcient exercise, were the main reasons behind his illness and 
consequent demise. I also believe that if he were to apply an eﬀective preventative 
nutritional approach and exercise programme as part of his daily routine, then he would 
still be alive today.  
It is for this reason why I wrote a book entitled ‘The Essential Guide to Sports 
Nutrition and Bodybuilding.’ My overall intention, whilst writing the book, was to not 
only cover the scientiﬁc fundamentals behind muscle growth and fat loss, but to also 
focus on the vital steps that need to be undertaken on a regular basis in order to live a 
long, vibrant and healthy life. My aim was to spread more awareness on the topic of 
disease prevention without detracting away from its relevance in the world of sports 
nutrition, exercise and bodybuilding. This 800-page book took over 5 years to write from 
its initial conception, and was ﬁnally completed and published in 2018. 
I followed this up with a book called ‘Lean Gains’ (second edition) which was 
published around the same time. In this book, I included a number of exercise routines 
which have been proven time and again to optimise muscle growth, increase stamina, 
improve ﬁtness and accentuate fat-loss.  
After receiving excellent feedback from trainees, personal trainers and regular gym-
attenders who undertook these exercise regimes, I decided to write this book.  
The routines in this book have been carefully thought-out and designed to not only 
ensure that your workouts are eﬀective, but to also eliminate any unnecessary dilly-
dallying in the gym.  
This book provides you with a step-by-step guide to all the exercise routines you need 
to undertake in order to achieve the results you’ve been waiting for. In addition, you will

As the name suggests, ‘The Ultimate Gym Workout’ is a book that you can 
conveniently refer back to before, after, or even during your workouts.

================================================================================
get an in-depth explanation and demonstration (ebook version) on how to do these 
exercises properly. 
‘The Ultimate Gym Workout’ should be used as an adjunct to either ‘Lean 
Gains’ (second edition) or ‘The Essential Guide to Sports Nutrition and 
Bodybuilding.’ 
 I really cannot stress this enough. The purpose of ‘The Ultimate Gym Workout’ is to 
help you make the most of your workouts and (to some degree) diet. The science and 
reasoning behind it are intentionally left out of this book, but are covered in immense 
detail in my other two books.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of my mentors. They 
have provided me with a deep understanding of the science behind all aspects of 
sports-related nutrition and physiology over the last 25+ years.  
I’d like to give special thanks to Dr Anthony Leeds, at Kings College London, and 
Professor Thomas Sanders. Their knowledge and wisdom so clearly displayed during 
our one-to-one tuition sessions over the years have contributed massively towards the 
backbone of many topics covered throughout this book. 
I would also like to acknowledge the extensive research undertaken by the plethora of 
doctors, scientists, nutritionists and researchers whose work has been referenced 
throughout this book. Without their notable contribution towards the world of sports 
nutrition and bodybuilding, I would not have been able to undertake this project.

I wish to extend my thanks to the many personal trainers, bodybuilders, and athletes 
I’ve had the pleasure of working with. They all took time out of their busy schedules to 
work alongside me on this project, and I am forever grateful to each and every one of 
them. That is why I have chosen to recognise these incredible individuals on 
pages x and xi of this book!
I’d also like to thank these individuals for the use of ‘Genesis Gym,’ ‘Simply Gym
(Walsall), ‘Solihull College Gym,’ and ‘PT Workspace’ where many of the photos 
within the book were taken.
Finally, I wish to thank my mother and my brother for  
their continual love and support whilst writing this book.

This is my fourth book in the ‘Lean
Gains’ series, and is probably the
most relevant when it comes to
providing gym-goers, dieters, 
newbies, and even bodybuilders 
with direct, ‘over-the-shoulder’ 
training advice (both inside and 
outside of the gym)…
Not doing the exercises properly (i.e., 
with the right form, posture, etc.) but
Sick of paying some personal trainer for 
hour-long sessions, only to completely 
forget everything he/she told you by 
the following week.
SO, WHAT WILL YOU GET OUT OF THIS BOOK?

DESIGNING AN  
EFFECTIVE  
PROGRAMME
CHAPTER  1 

================================================================================
Designing an Effective Programme
SO, WHAT DO WE WANT TO ACHIEVE  
FROM OUR GYM WORKOUTS? 
Going to the gym to lift weights and perform cardio on a regular basis feels great. Once 
you do so, you WILL produce more dopamine, release endorphins, and improve your 
overall health and well-being.  
However, if your long-term goal is to gain and/or maintain muscle mass during a 
bulking or cutting phase, then we have to tailor our workouts to more speciﬁc goals. 
By performing the workouts  
outlined within this book, you will: 
Maintain and/Gain Muscle 
• The aim of our workouts is to progressively overload so as to maximise muscle
growth during a bulk and minimise muscle loss during a cut. 
• Your aim is to increase the weight or number of reps as time goes on. 
• We’re also looking at training each major muscle group twice a week. We
accomplish this by training the working muscle directly one week [eg. Squats for
legs] and indirectly on another day during the week [eg. Deadlifts, although
focusing on back, also give the legs a nice workout]. 
Improve Insulin Sensitivity  
• We want to attain and maintain insulin sensitivity whether we’re bulking or cutting.
A high-insulin sensitivity increases the chance of muscles utilising calories from
food as opposed to those calories being stored as fat. 
• The best way of increasing insulin- sensitivity is by doing exercises inclusive of
both cardio and weight-training. 
• High insulin-sensitivity reduces the amount of fat you gain during a bulk and
maximises the amount of fat you burn during a cut so it’s a win win. 
#3

================================================================================
The Ultimate Gym Workout
Gain Strength 
• When you progressively overload, you’re getting stronger and your muscles will 
start to grow and (more importantly) show as a consequence. This is especially 
the case when you’re bulking, or if you are new to the gym. 
• Progressive overload and consistent weight training is also vital for maintaining 
more muscle during the cutting phase. 
Burn Fat 
You’re going to ﬁnd it very diﬃcult to burn fat in the long run if you’re not training.  
If you’re not giving your muscles a good workout regularly, they will shrink in size. 
The combination of lean muscle mass and regular exercise will boost your metabolic 
rate, which means you will burn a ton of calories [and hence fat] both in the gym and 
when you’re resting. You therefore want to not only keep as much muscle as you 
can but also train regularly. 
Increase Metabolic Rate 
These workouts will increase you basal and resting metabolic rate meaning that 
you will be burning more energy [predominantly from fat] when you’re resting. 
Do Cardio But Not Too Much 
Cardio is recommended, but in order to avoid overtraining, it’s best to limit cardio 
sessions (especially HIIT) to no more than 2 to 3 times a week. Since these workouts 
are very demanding, more than 3 cardio sessions per week in addition to the 
routines indicated in this book may well interfere recovery.

================================================================================
Designing an Effective Programme
•
When it comes to growing and maintaining muscle mass, we must embrace the 
following principles into our workout programme: 
•
Progressive overload. 
•
Compound Exercises. 
[eg. bench press, squats, deadlifts] 
•
Heavy Weights   
[most of the time]                                                
•
Light Weights                                                    
 [Yes!! Light weights do have their place!]] 
•
You will get fantastic results if you keep your gym sessions regular and apply the 
above principles to your workout regime.  
•
However, that may not be enough to get the killer body you’ve always wanted. In 
addition, therefore, you will need to focus on: 
•
Speciﬁc isolation exercises to help grow and develop weaker/smaller 
muscles.  
•
Both higher and lower rep exercises for certain muscles [eg. abs] with a 
higher proportion of Type I muscles ﬁbres. 
•
Training smaller muscle groups [eg. calves, abs] more frequently.  
•
In part three, we’ll focus on the major muscle groups you will be working on during 
your gym sessions, and how these prescribed exercises beneﬁt them.

================================================================================
The Ultimate Gym Workout
The Muscles We Need To Pay Attention To 
•
Your workouts will revolve around 9 diﬀerent parts of the body:
•CHEST
•SHOULDERS
•LEGS
•CALVES
•BICEPS
•TRICEPS
•ABS
•BACK
•BUTT (Mainly Females)
•
There are a number of exercises you can apply to these workouts that will target the
muscles in these areas. However, you won’t need to bombard your workouts with 
a ton of exercises that may or may not be ‘beneﬁcial’ to your goals. 
•
Instead, we’re going to keep things simple yet extremely eﬀective.
•
The following chapter highlights the exercises you will need to learn and master.
•
These are workouts that have been proven time and again to yield the best
results when done properly. 
•
Once you’ve learnt them, you won’t need to do anything else.
•
However, you may come across ‘new’ exercises from YouTube, gym-buddies, etc.
during your ‘body transformation’ journey which aren’t included here. As long as 
they’re safe and you’re comfortable doing them, then feel free to add them to 
your workouts. However, you should view them as ‘non-essential bonuses’ in 
addition to what I’ve outlined for you; and be weary of overtraining.

THE MUSCLES YOU 
NEED TO FOCUS ON
CHAPTER  + 

================================================================================
Designing an Effective Programme
A Few Words of Caution  
Before We Get Stuck In! 
•
The majority of the workouts within this book will involve lifting weights (as the name
of the book suggests lol).  
•
If you’re new to weight training, then the weights should be intentionally light in the
beginning. This is to allow your muscles to get used to weight-training routines, as 
well as develop what we call a ‘mind-muscle connection.’ 
•
Once you’re ready to move on, you will be applying the three principles necessary
for muscle growth [i.e., progressive overload, time-under-tension and cellular fatigue 
(as described in   detail in my other book ‘Lean Gains’ and ‘The Essential Guide to 
Sports Nutrition and Bodybuilding’)] to your workouts.  
•
The great thing about the workouts in part three is that they have been carefully
thought out and designed so as to embrace all three of these principles. 
•
In each chapter, we will be going through the prescribed exercises, and describing
how to perform them properly.  
•
Ensuring that you’re weight-training properly, especially when you start to lift the
heavier weights, is absolutely crucial when it comes to injury prevention.

YOUR NEW  
WORKOUT 
REGIME 

================================================================================
Your New Workout Regime
The Exercises You  
Will Be Focusing On 
•
Compound exercises on the whole are generally preferred to isolation exercises,
and should take priority in your weightlifting protocol.  
•
Your workouts should always start with the ‘essential’ exercises. You can then
decide to do 3 sets of any 2 exercises from the ‘extras’ exercises.  
•
Do the ‘essential’ exercises in the order that they’re written. 
•
Do 2 diﬀerent exercises from the ‘extra’ exercises every week, but keep the
‘essential’ exercises the same. Remember, the focus of the ‘essential’ exercises is
progressive overload, so try to add more weight each week, if possible, until you’re
struggling to reach the maximum rep range for that exercise.  If you can’t add more
weight, then focus on doing more reps. 
•
The ‘rest’ period at the right side of each table represents the approximate length of
time you should be resting between sets. 
•
Make it your duty to learn and master each and every one of these exercises. You
won’t need to mess about with machines or any other fancy gym equipment if you
apply the exercises below to your workout 
Workout Routines 
In this section, we will cover the workout routines you will be doing. They’ve been 
divided into 4 sections including a beginner routine and warming up routine.  
The warm up is essential before each routine except the ‘beginner exercises’ which will 
require a slightly diﬀerent warm up routine: 
$13

================================================================================
The Essential Guide to Lifting Weights
Warm-Up Routines 
Warming up the right way is absolutely essential as this will enable you to lift heavy 
weights with minimal risk of injury. It will also allow you to become stronger and lift 
heavier weights during your workout.  
Beginner 
This is for those who are new to the gym and not accustomed to doing weight training. 
They should do these exercises for the ﬁrst month (at least) before progressing onto 
‘Option A’ or ‘Option B.’ 
Option A: 5-Day Workout
This workout routine comprises of ﬁve days in the gym and two days of rest. During 
each workout routine, emphasis will be placed on two major muscle groups. 
Option B: 3-Day Workout
This workout routine comprises of three days in the gym and four days of rest. Option 
B is more suited for those who prefer not to train 5 days a week. The emphasis is 
placed on three muscle groups per session. 
The ‘DeLoad’ Week
This ‘deload’ week consists of doing ‘beginner-style’ workouts consisting of 10-12 
reps for 1 week. These exercises are intentionally designed to consist of relatively 
simple workouts inﬂicting minimal stress to the muscles.  
Lifting ‘heavy’ all the time creates immense physical stress on the body after a while, so 
it’s essential to include a ‘de-load’ at the end of each training cycle [i.e., every two 
months or so] and let the body rest from strength-training for a while.  
That way, when you’re ready to go heavy again, the muscles have been well-rested and 
rearing to go.  
$14

================================================================================
Your New Workout Regime
When embarking on a de-load week, ensure that you’re using relatively light weights 
throughout.
The alternative to a de-load is to refrain from any weight-training at all for a week and 
just rest completely [with the exception of mild cardio perhaps]. 
How Should You Warm Up?
The aim here is to gradually increase blood ﬂow to the working muscles by making 
incremental increases in weight from light-to-heavy. 
Warming up this way enables your body to perform at a much greater intensity when it 
comes to performing your working sets. 
Do a 3-5-minute light jog on a treadmill. This increases blood ﬂow around the body and 
increases body temperature. 
Decide on the exercise you’re going to do and carry out 10-12 reps at 50% of the 
weight that you would usually lift for a set of 4-6 reps. For example, if you’re doing 
bench press and you usually lift 120kg for 4-6 reps, then do 10-12 reps of 60kg. The 
bottom line is that you should be lifting a weight that’s very easy to move about. 
Have a break for around a minute and then repeat. 
By this stage, you should go from feeling cold and stiﬀ to feeling loose and energised.

================================================================================
The Essential Guide to Lifting Weights
Important Tips About Warming Up  
•
Always do a warm-up before training each muscle group. For example, if you’re 
doing legs and back in one session, do a warm up for legs and then do a warm 
up for back once you’ve ﬁnished training legs.  
•
Warm-up on the ﬁrst exercise you’re doing for each muscle group. So if your 
ﬁrst exercise, for instance, is military press, then warm-up on the military press 
[which trains your shoulders]. If you choose to move onto the next shoulder 
exercises, once you’ve completed the military press, you don’t need to warm-up 
again. However, if you decide to train your back afterwards by doing deadlifts, 
for example, then warm-up on the deadlifts.  
•
Do a series of 4 warm up sets for each muscle group you train. [A working set 
is the main exercise you’re going to do once you’ve warmed up].

THE  
BEGINNER’S  
WORKOUT 

================================================================================
The Beginner’s Workout
Beginners 
 Who Is A Beginner? 
•
A beginner is someone who:
✴has never trained with weights before,
✴very rarely does any weight training, even if they attend the gym regularly,
✴or [in this particular situation] someone who has experience in weight-
training, but hasn’t trained in a very long time [i.e., de-trained weightlifters].
Why Are Beginners Treated Diﬀerently? 
• Lifting weights is crucial for:
✴Maintaining muscle during fat loss and maintenance phases of your diet.
✴Growing muscle when you’re on a calorie-surplus.
• However, the most eﬀective way of beneﬁting from weight-training in the long-term is
by setting in place a basis for our training routines. In the
beginning, this will appear foreign to the ‘un-trained’ or ‘de-    
    trained' body. 
• It’s therefore important that a beginner does not rush into a conventional strength-
training programme. Ensuring that the
beginner is adept to the necessary movements required for muscle growth is of
paramount importance.
!21

================================================================================
The Ultimate Gym Workout
• In other words, a beginner should use relatively light weights for their ﬁrst month or 2, 
and focus on basic compound exercises. Being able to do this serves 2 purposes: 
1. It provides the trainee with a foundation from which they can eventually add more 
weight, build muscle and become stronger whilst minimising risk of injury. 
2. The use of light weights from the very beginning allows the trainee to get used to 
training ‘the right way,’ optimise their coordination and do the required exercises with 
excellent form.
• A workout for a beginner, using this programme, is pretty basic and will consist of 2 
diﬀerent workouts on alternate days 3 times a week.
• As long as you’re alternating your routine with one day oﬀ in between, then the day 
you start these exercises are not important. For simplicity, we’ll assume that ‘Day 
One’ is Monday.

Deload Week
THE BOTTOM LINE 
Deload weeks are designed to help the muscles ‘rest’ between training cycles 
and are recommended every 8-12 weeks for both men and women. 
The alternative to a ‘deload’ week is a complete break from training for one 
week. 
These exercises should be easy to undertake and will prove to be a nice, ‘active’ 
break from your regular and more rigorous training routines.

CHAPTER 2 
YOUR NEW  
CARDIO  
ROUTINE 

================================================================================
Your New Cardio Routine
•
As mentioned in ‘Lean Gains,’ cardio is an excellent adjunct to your routine 
weight-training sessions. 
•
To avoid overtraining, try to restrict cardio to no more than 2 times a week, 
and ideally leave a minimum of 7 hours after your weight training session 
(eg. weights in morning, cardio in evening). 
•
There are three types of cardio that you can do in the gym: 
1. High-Intensity-Interval-Training (HIIT) 
2. Low-Intensity-Interval-Training  or  Steady-State Cardio. 
3. Metabolic Resistance Training. 
High-Intensity-Interval-Training 
•
Limit HIIT sessions to no more 
than twice a week if you’re 
weight training. 
•
HIIT sessions should not exceed 
30 minutes. 
•
Ensure at least 90 seconds to 2 
minutes for recovery between 
HIIT exercises.  
•
Recovery times will vary between 
individuals, but it’s paramount that 
you’re fully recovered before 
exerting near maximum intensity 
for 30 seconds. 
There are many HIIT exercises you can do, but the  
following exercises are just a handful.

Your New Cardio Routine
2. Circuit Training 
•
Circuit training is a fast-paced series of exercises whereby you do one 
exercise for around 30 seconds to 2 minutes and then move on to another 
exercise. 
•
You can use a timer on your phone, or get hold of a ‘gym-boss.’ A ‘beep’ 
will sound after a prescribed length of time (eg. 30 seconds) telling you it’s 
time to move onto the next exercise. There are hundreds of circuit training 
routines you can apply to your HIIT workouts.  
•
Below is one that I regularly use. I repeat this routine 5 times. Including the 
warm-up, this adds up to a 25 minute HIIT session.

3. Metabolic Resistance Training 
• The rule of thumb, for the ‘ideal’ MRT circuit, is to follow the protocols below: 
- Light weight 
- Compound Exercises 
- Short rest periods between circuits (around 2 minutes). 
- The workout is essentially a HIIT workout so it shouldn’t last more than 30 
minutes. 
• The MRT workout is an excellent alternative to the more typical circuit training 
and/or HIIT routines.

Your New Cardio Routine
Low-Intensity-Interval-Training 
•
This is sometimes referred to as ‘steady-state’ cardio. 
•
Almost any form of exercise that you can sustain for over 30 minutes can be 
classed as steady state cardio and can do wonders for your ﬁtness. 
•
Examples include walking, jogging on a treadmill, rowing machines, 
cycling machines, etc.

Stretching and Yoga 
•
The routines outlined in this book, in conjunction with a good all-round diet, 
will get you the results you’ve been looking for. 
•
Your cardio routine will improve blood ﬂow throughout the body and help keep 
your muscles nice and supple.  
•
However, even with cardio, doing these routines on a regular basis may cause 
your muscles to tighten up after a while causing you to feel less ﬂexible. This 
is why it’s important to spend 5 minutes or so stretching after each workout. 
•
It’s also a good idea to start doing yoga. I would suggest incorporating at 
least 2 yoga classes per month into your routine. Doing this will not only 
reduce the risk of injury, but also improve your core strength as well as your 
overall ﬂexibility.

CHAPTER 10

================================================================================
Chest Workouts
1. Flat-Barbell Bench Press 
1. Lie Down on the bench with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor. 
2. Ensure shoulder blades are squeezed together and down towards your 
waist. (Imagine trying to squeeze a grape between your shoulder blades). 
Your grip should only be a few inches wider than shoulder width. At the same 
time, push your upper back into the bench. 
3. Arch your back to maintain a neutral spine (Figure 1). It should be big 
enough to allow someone’s ﬁst to ﬁt between the arch and the bench. 
4. Make sure you have a ﬁrm and tight grip of the bar, and that you’re gripping 
the bar as far down your palm as possible (Figure 2). This is very important 
since if the bar is too high in your hand or ﬁngers, you put tremendous 
pressure on your wrists. 
5. By this stage, your body should as if it’s one ﬁrm, tight, and solid unit. You 
also want to ensure that your upper back, neck and butt are touching the 
bench. At the same time your feet and heals should be ﬂat on the ﬂoor. 
6. Take a deep breath, stabilise your lower body by tightening your quads, abs 
and glutes. As you lift the bar, pretend as if you’re trying to bend the bar 
towards you into a U-shape with your hands. By doing this, you’re tucking 
in your elbows and hence protecting your shoulders from any potential 
damage. 
7. As you bring the bar down, ensure your forearms are moving up and down 
in a straight line at a 90 degree angle to the ﬂoor. 
8. Bring the bar down until it touches your nipple/upper abs (Figure 3). Ensure 
upper arms and elbows are at around a horizontal 45 degrees angle to the 
torso when the bar is down.

9. Wherever the bar touches you, try to hit the same spot every time. 
10.Lift the bar by tightening your glutes and pushing your feet into the ﬂoor 
(Figure 4). This allows you to push more weight and stay tight. As you lift the 
bar, exhale. 
11. Now unlike the squats and deadlifts (which will be discussed later on), the 
bar movement will not be a simple vertical up and down motion. Our 
anatomy calls for a slight curve-path upwards and downwards towards the 
rack. 
 
Additional Tip 
•
Ensure a controlled and smooth motion whilst you’re bringing the bar down. 
Do not bounce the bar oﬀ your chest. This can lead to immense stress on 
your shoulders and sternum. 
•
Do not ﬂare your elbows or grip too wide as this can cause damage to your 
shoulders and pec muscles. 
•
Ensure you keep your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and your core tight throughout the 
whole movement. 
•
Asking a friend to spot you is a good idea if you’re a beginner or lifting a 
heavy weight.

2. Inclined-Barbell Bench Press
•
The advice is the same as for the ﬂat barbell bench press, but: 
•
Instead of using a ﬂat bench, select a bench with a 30-45 degree
angle. 
•
You will be bringing the barbell down in a vertical motion passed the
chin to your upper chest (just below the collar bone) as opposed to
your nipple/upper torso (see Figure 5).

3. Flat Dumbbell Bench Press 
•
Dumbbell bench press is very similar to barbell bench press with regards to 
set-up, but allows for a fuller range of motion compared to the barbell bench 
press. This allows for a deeper stretch at the bottom of the movement and a 
tight contraction at the top of the movement, and a tighter contraction at the 
top of the movement. 
•
Also, because the dumbbell press requires more stability, especially around 
the shoulder region, you get the additional beneﬁt of strengthening these 
‘stabiliser’ muscles. In addition, if you’re training to failure, you don’t need 
a spotter. It’s much safer with dumbbells since you can simply drop the 
weights to the ﬂoor. 
•
The only real downside with the dumbbell bench press is that you will not be 
able to lift as much weight as with the barbell bench press. 
•
So here’s how you do a ﬂat dumbbell bench press: 
1. Sit down on a ﬂat bench with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor. 
2. Lean back and bring dumbbells to shoulder level. 
3. Ensure shoulder blades are squeezed together and down towards your 
waist. (Imagine trying to squeeze a grape between your shoulder blades). 
Your grip should only be a few inches wider than shoulder width. At the same 
time, push your upper back into the bench. 
4. Arch your back to maintain a neutral spine. It should be big enough to allow 
someone’s ﬁst to ﬁt between the arch and the bench. 
5. Make sure you have a ﬁrm and tight grip of the dumbbell and rotate your 
wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. 
6. Take a deep breath at the same time as bringing your chest out. Ensure 
that the dumbbells are parallel to over the lower part of your chest.
